# 2.2.9 Cycle 9: GPS Jammer & Drone search

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I will aim to create both the GPS Jammer and Drone search items, complete with all their functionality. I will not implement merging items (as mentioned in [#item-interactions](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#item-interactions "mention")). This will ensure that the game has additional features beyond typical "hide-and-seek" behaviour, and will mean that some of the items displayed on the map will be useful. I will also seek to implement different intensity of actions depending on the items rarity.

* [ ] Create GPS Jammer item
* [ ] Create Drone search item: Need to create a heat-map display and render it to the client
* [ ] Implement action intensities dependent on item rarity

### Usability

* [ ] Clearly show the action intensity on the action button - for instance, a common GPS Jammer may say "JAM GPS (2 mins)" whereas an epic GPS Jammer would say "JAM GPS (10 minutes).
* [ ] Show when an item is in use, i.e. with a coloured background in the inventory
* [ ] Create visual or audio effects for when an item affects another player
  * [ ] Drone: A quiet buzzing should be audible for nearby Hunted players
  * [ ] GPS Jammer: A constant glitching animation should visible on the map screen for nearby all Hunters
