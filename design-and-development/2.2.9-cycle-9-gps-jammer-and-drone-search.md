## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I will aim to create both the GPS Jammer and Drone search items, complete with all their functionality. I will not implement merging items (as mentioned in [#item-interactions](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#item-interactions "mention")). This will ensure that the game has additional features beyond typical "hide-and-seek" behaviour, and will mean that some of the items displayed on the map will be useful. I will also seek to implement different intensity of actions depending on the items rarity. Drone recharging will not be added in this cycle.

* [x] Create GPS Jammer item: Need to glitch map rendering on nearby Hunted clients
* [x] Create Drone search item: Need to create a heat-map display and render it to the client
* [x] Implement action intensities dependent on item rarity

### Usability

* [x] Clearly show the action intensity on the action button - for instance, a common GPS Jammer may say "JAM GPS (2 mins)" whereas an epic GPS Jammer would say "JAM GPS (10 minutes).
* [x] Show when an item is in use, i.e. with a coloured background in the inventory
* [x] Create visual or audio effects for when an item affects another player
  * [x] Drone: A quiet buzzing should be audible for nearby Hunted players
  * [x] GPS Jammer: A constant glitching animation should visible on the map screen for nearby all Hunters

### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| item.active   | Stores a boolean value of whether or not the item is active. |
| player.items  | Stores all items contained in a player                       |
| effects       | Stores active effects - buzzing noise, or map glitching      |

### Pseudocode

<pre><code><strong>subroutine on_action_click (item, player)
</strong>    send message to server
    message recieved by server
    send item-active message to requesting player
    applicable_players = get nearby players not of item.type
    send effect-active to applicable players
    
    add effect to effects of applicable_players
    set item.active = true
    
    subroutine timeout for item.effect.duration
        send an effect-disabled to players with item.effect.id in effects list
        send an item-disabled message to player
        set item.active = false
        set item.used = true
    end subroutine        
end subroutine

subroutine on_receipt_effect_active (effect)
    switch (effect)
        case 'gps-glitch'
            display map glitch overlay
        case 'drone-buzz'
            play low frequency buzz
    end switch
end subroutine</code></pre>

### UI Mockup

![](../.gitbook/assets/MOSHED-2022-9-15-14-52-57.gif)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

* On the left is the intended GPS Jammer screen that will appear when the Hunter is within range of the player who triggered the GPS Jammer.
* On the right is the Drone Heatmap that will appear, where the orange blobs are where a Hunted player  could be - the false positive rate will be 80:20

## Development

### Item Infrastructure

#### Item Information

When a player views an item in their inventory, they will see a large red button with an action relevant to said item: For instance, the GPS Button says "JAM GPS" and the Drone Search Button says "DEPLOY DRONE". This is facilitated by modifying the `itemDetails` dictionary created in Cycle 8 ([#inventory-ui](2.2.8-cycle-8-item-optimisation.md#inventory-ui "mention")).

```typescript
export const itemDetails = {
  gpsj: {
    desc: 'A GPS Jammer that will disable GPS functionality for all other hunters',
    action: 'JAM GPS',
  },
  drse: {
    desc: 'A Drone that will scan the area for fugitives, and display a heatmap. Sometimes temperamental',
    action: 'DEPLOY DRONE',
  },
} as Record<Item['info']['code'], {desc: string; action: string}>;
```

Each element has a key which corresponds to a given item's code, and description and action text, which are rendered in their appropriate regions.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_(iPhone 12 Pro) (5).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_(iPhone 12 Pro) (1).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
The item images are currently cute pictures of cats üê±, to act as placeholders. I plan to change this in a future cycle.
{% endhint %}

The duration that an item will be active for is displayed in brackets. This is implemented by adding duration information to the `Item` object, in a similar way to how I added rarity information - when creating the item, a `baseDuration` variable is defined, and is multiplied by the item's `rarity` according to the following formula:

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript">const types = {
  hunted: [
    {
      name: 'GPS Jammer',
      code: 'gpsj',
<strong>      baseRarity: 1,
</strong>      baseDuration: 5,
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
// rarity is defined earlier as discussed in detail in Cycle 6
const duration = item.baseDuration * (rarity - item.baseRarity + 1)</code></pre>

The `Item` object is hence modified as follows:

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript"><strong>export type Item = {
</strong>  id: string;
  location: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
  };
  info: {
    name: string;
    code: string;
    type: 'hunter' | 'hunted';
    rarity: number;
    baseRarity: number;
    duration: number; // Added : Stores item active duration in minutes
  };
  active: boolean; // Added : Stores an items state - active or inactive
  activeStart?: number; // Added : Stores a timestamp of when an item became active
};</code></pre>

#### Item Usage

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A flowchart to show what happens when a player uses an item</p></figcaption></figure>

When a user clicks the use button, the server will identify the item from the id in the message and call `item.use()`:

```typescript
use(player: Player) {
  this.activeStart = Date.now();

  switch (this.info.code) {
    case 'gpsj': // GPS Jammer
      ...
      break;
    case 'drse': // Drone Search
      ...
      break;
  }
```

Several events will occur as a result of calling `item.use():`

<details>

<summary>effect-active</summary>

_Message format_

```typescript
// Using Drone Search (drse) as an example
socket.emit('effect-active', {
  id: string;
  code: 'drse'
  data: [{
    point: {lat: number, lng: number}
    intensity: number
  }, ...]
  duration: number
})
```

_Client logic_

I defined an atom (a piece of global state), called `effects`. This will store all the currently active effects on a client and allow them to be accessed from anywhere in the codebase. The `effects` list contains effect objects (as defined above).

The below function mutates the `effects` list when a new effect is received

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript">'effect-active': data => {
<strong>  setEffects(prev => [...prev, data]);
</strong>},</code></pre>

</details>

<details>

<summary>item-active</summary>

When an item is active, we simply send a confirmation to the player who activated the item

_Message format_

```typescript
const activeStart = Date.now()
socket.emit('item-active',  {
  id: string // Item ID
  start: activeStart // UNIX timestamp
})
```

_Client logic_

Although the below flow looks complicated, it simply modifies the client player's item with the `active` boolean, and the start time.

```typescript
'item-active': data => {
  if (me?.items) {
    const item = me.items.find(i => i.id === data.id)!;
    setPlayers(prev => [
      ...prev.filter(p => p.id !== me.id),
      {
        ...me,
        items: [
          ...me.items!.filter(i => i.id !== data.id),
          {...item, active: true, activeStart: data.start},
        ],
      },
    ]);
  }
},
```

_Inventory UI_

When `item.active` is true, the background of the item thumbnail will be green

```tsx
<VStack
  bg={item && item.active ? 'green.200' : 'white'}
>
  ...
</VStack>
```

And in order to display the time remaining on the item page:

```typescript
export const GridItem = (props: {item: Item | undefined}) => {
  const item = props.item;
  const [open, setOpen] = useState<boolean>(false) 
  const [time, setTime] = useState<number>(item ? item.info.duration * 60 : 0);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (item?.activeStart) {
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        const newTime =
          item.info.duration * 60 - Math.floor((Date.now() - item.activeStart!) / 1000);
        setTime(newTime);
      }, 1000);

      return () => clearInterval(interval);
    }
  });
  
  // The `time` variable (secs) is then used render remaining duration
}
```

</details>

The `inactive/used` messages are triggered with the following `setTimeout`

```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  player.socket.emit('item-used', {
    id: string,
  });

  // Removes item from game and player on server-side
  this.game.items = this.game.items.filter(i => i.id !== this.id);
  player.items = player.items.filter(i => i.id !== this.id);
}, this.info.duration * 60 * 1000);
```

<details>

<summary>effect-inactive</summary>

Within each switch-case, a `setTimeout` function will be defined, that will disable the effect once its duration has finished. One of the messages it will send is an `effect-inactive` message to all clients who received the effect

_Message format_

```typescript
socket.emit('effect-inactive', {
  id: string; // The id corresponding to the effect, and hence, the item
})
```

_Client logic_

As mentioned previously, I can mutate the `effects` atom on receipt of the above message to remove the effect from the client.

```typescript
'effect-inactive': data => {
  setEffects(prev => prev.filter(e => e.id !== data.id));
}
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>item-used</summary>

I have not added any recharging or cooldown time to items in the cycle, so currently, when the item has been active for its respective duration, it is removed from the players inventory and from the game.

_Message format_

```typescript
socket.emit('item-used', {
  id: string
});
```

_Client Logic_

This flow simply removes the item from the players inventory

```typescript
'item-used': data => {
  if (me?.items) {
    setPlayers(prev => [
      ...prev.filter(p => p.id !== me.id),
      {...me, items: me.items?.filter(i => i.id !== data.id)},
    ]);
  }
},
```

</details>

#### Effects UI

In order to display the different effects on the client, I created an `<EffectsOverlay/>` in the `<GameContainer/>` component (See: [2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md](2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md "mention"))

```tsx
export const GameContainer = () => {
  ...
  return (
    <Flex h={'100vh'} w={'full'} flexDir={'column'}>
      <Flex h={'full'} position={'relative'}>
        <EffectsOverlay /> // Added - replaces <Map/> component
        {me?.catching && <CatchOverlay />}
        {game.hasEnded && <WinLose />}
        {page === 'inventory' && <Inventory closeFn={() => setPage(false)} />}
      </Flex>
      <GameFooter
        inventoryOnClick={() => setPage(p => (p === 'inventory' ? false : 'inventory'))}
        settingsOnClick={() => setPage(p => (p === 'settings' ? false : 'settings'))}
      />
    </Flex>
  );
};
```

Within the `<EffectOverlay/>` , there's a switch-case statement to determine the relevant overlay to render for a given effect. Every overlay also contains the `<Map/>` . The reason the `<Map/>` is rendered within each overlay, is because certain modifications to the map need to be made for a certain effects. For instance, the drone search needs to render circles to the map for the heat-map.

```typescript
export const EffectsOverlay = () => {
  const [effects] = useEffects();

  const codesMap = effects.map(e => e.code);

  switch (true) {
    case codesMap.includes('gpsj'):
      ...
    case codesMap.includes('drse'):
      ...
    case codesMap.includes('drsehunted'):
      ....
    default:
      return <Map />;
  }
};
```

### GPS Jammer

This the server-side code within the switch-case `gpsj`:

```typescript
// Finds hunters within a given radius of the player, dependant on item rarity
const nearbyHunters = this.game.hunter.filter(
  p =>
    p.location &&
    player.location &&
    distance(p.location, player.location) < [1000, 2000, 3000][this.info.rarity - 1]
);
// Sends an effect active message to each hunter - no additional data is required
nearbyHunters.forEach(p => {
  p.socket.emit('effect-active', {
    id: this.id,
    code: 'gpsj',
    data: undefined,
    duration: this.info.duration,
  });
});
// Sends an effect inactive message to each hunter after the item duration has elapsed
setTimeout(() => {
  nearbyHunters.forEach(p => {
    p.socket.emit('effect-inactive', {
      id: this.id,
    });
  });
}, this.info.duration * 60 * 1000);
break;
```

On the client, the relevant `gpsj` overlay will be rendered as follows

```tsx
const GPSOverlay = () => {
  // This hook uses the `react-powerglitch` library, which adds random width 
  // rectangles that move over the map. See Testing for more clarity
  const glitch = useGlitch({
    // The options for the glitch effect
    hideOverflow: false,
    glitchTimeSpan: {
      start: 0,
      end: 600,
    },
    slice: {hueRotate: true},
    timing: {duration: 1000},
  });
  return (
    // The container over which the glitching occurst
    <Box
      ref={glitch.ref}
      position={'absolute'}
      w={'100%'}
      height={'100%'}
      bg="black"
      zIndex={8000}
      maxW={'100vw'}
      overflow={'hidden'}
    >
      <Map />
    </Box>
  );
};
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Unfortunately, the complex effects seen in [#ui-mockup](2.2.9-cycle-9-gps-jammer-and-drone-search.md#ui-mockup "mention") were generated using a close-source, proprietary tool and hence would be time consuming and difficult to implement. Functionally, the `react-powerglicth` library makes the map near impossible to read, which is the core purpose, despite having inferior aesthetics.
{% endhint %}

An example of this effect in action can be seen in [#evidence](2.2.9-cycle-9-gps-jammer-and-drone-search.md#evidence "mention")

### Drone Search

This the server-side code within the switch-case `drse`:

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript"><strong>// Finds all hunted players within a given radius of the player, 
</strong><strong>// dependant on item rarity
</strong>const playersInRange = this.game.hunted.filter(p => {
  console.log(distance(p.location!, player.location!));
  return (
    p.location &#x26;&#x26;
    player.location &#x26;&#x26;
    distance(p.location, player.location) &#x3C; [1000, 2000][this.info.rarity - 2]
  );
});
// Sends effect data to requesting player - drone heatmap
player.socket.emit('effect-active', {
  id: this.id,
  code: 'drse',
  data: [
    // Creates an object for each player with a long, lat co-ordinate, and a *random*
    // intesity between 20-50
    ...playersInRange.map(p => ({
      point: {lat: p.location!.latitude, lng: p.location!.longitude},
      intensity: randomBetweenIntervalInt(20, 50),
    })),
    // Creates 4 random points (if Rare) or 2 (if Epic), that are within the same
    // radius of the player, within the polygon and with a random 20-50 intensity 
    ...Array(0, [4, 2][this.info.rarity - 2])
      .fill(0)
      .map(() => ({
        point: generateRandomPointInRange(
          player.location!,
          [1000, 2000][this.info.rarity - 2],
          this.game.options.vertices
        ),
        intensity: randomBetweenIntervalInt(20, 50),
      })),
  ],
  duration: this.info.duration,
});
// In order to implement the "drone buzz", I created a seperate effect called
// `drsehunted`, with no data. This will trigger a buzzing noise on the client
playersInRange.forEach(playerRange => {
  playerRange.socket.emit('effect-active', {
    id: this.id,
    code: 'drsehunted',
    data: undefined,
    duration: this.info.duration,
  });
});

// Sends an effect inactive message to all affected players after the 
// item duration has elapsed
setTimeout(() => {
  player.socket.emit('effect-inactive', {
    id: this.id,
  });
  playersInRange.forEach(p => {
    p.socket.emit('effect-inactive', {
      id: this.id,
    });
  });
}, this.info.duration * 60 * 1000);</code></pre>

On the client, the primarily overlay, displaying the drone search heat-map is as follows

```tsx
import {Box, theme, VStack, Text, Button, Heading} from '@chakra-ui/react';
import {EffectUseData, ServerMessages} from '@monorepo/shared';
import {useState} from 'react';
import {Circle} from 'react-leaflet';
import {Map} from '../map/Map';
import {Marker} from '../map/MapInner';

export default (props: {effect: ServerMessages['effect-active']}) => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(true);
  const effect = props.effect;

  return (
    // If the heatmap is open, don't display item or player locaiton markesr
    <Map markers={!open}>
      // Creates a button on the bottom of the screen, with text. Shown in UI Mockup
      // Allows for showing and hiding heatmap-overlay
      <VStack zIndex={800} position="absolute" bottom={0} pb={4} w="full" justifyContent={'center'}>
        {open && (
          <Text fontSize={'xl'} color={'white'}>
            Currently viewing
          </Text>
        )}
        // Add the word ACTIVE if the heatmap is closed.
        <Heading size={'xl'} color={'white'}>
          DRONE HEATMAP {!open && 'ACTIVE'}
        </Heading>
        // Changes the bottom button to be 'EXIT' or 'OPEN' depending on open state.
        <Button
          colorScheme={open ? 'red' : 'green'}
          px={8}
          fontSize={'2xl'}
          onClick={() => setOpen(prev => !prev)}
        >
          {open ? 'EXIT' : 'OPEN'}
        </Button>
      </VStack>
      // This is a blur overlay of 50px that ensures suitable fuzziness of heatmap
      // (see: Evidence)
      <Box
        w="full"
        h="full"
        backdropFilter={open ? 'blur(50px)' : 'none'}
        position={'absolute'}
        zIndex={700}
      />
      {open &&
        // For each point recieved from the server, render an orange Circle to the map 
        // with the given point as its center and the intensity * 10 as its radius
        (effect.data as EffectUseData['drse']).map(({point, intensity}) => {
          return (
            <Circle
              center={point}
              key={effect.id + JSON.stringify(point)}
              radius={intensity * 10}
              color={theme.colors['orange']['400']}
              fillOpacity={1}
            />
          );
        })}
    </Map>
  );
};
```

#### Drone Buzz

The drone buzz is implemented on the client within the switch-case `drsehunted`, as follows:

```typescript
return (
  <>
    // To play the audio, I embed an HTML audio tag that loops and audio plays
    <audio loop={true} autoPlay={true}>
      <source src={'drone-buzz.mp3'} type={'audio/mpeg'} />
    </audio>
    // The map is also included with no modifications.
    <Map />
  </>
);
```

### Challenges

With regard to implementation, the only challenge was working out how to create a "glitch" effect from the GPS Jammer - many of the libraries I found did not work with React, or only worked with text. Implementing the library was also somewhat challenging, with intermittent bugs appearing when rendering the glitch effect. However, upon tweaking the options and the styling of the surrounding `<Box/>`, I got it to a functional state.

## Testing
