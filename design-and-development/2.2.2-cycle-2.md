# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to get a login system and a game creation and lobby system implemented. I will attempt to make the process as frictionless as possible and ensure it is clear how to join or create a game. I'll need to establish some standardised system for communication with the server, and will need to ensure that I have appropriate "Game" and "Player" objects which can be manipulated and modified. There will also likely be a lot of boilerplate development required, wherein I will create methods and subroutines that will be used in later Cycles.

* [x] Implement a simple, frictionless login system - likely using Google OAuth
* [x] Create a lobby screen where users can see other players and switch roles
* [x] Create a game creation and joining system with game codes
* [x] Establish types and centralised subroutines where communication between the client and the server will occur
