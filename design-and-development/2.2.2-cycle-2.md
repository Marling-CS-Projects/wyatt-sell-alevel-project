# 2.2.2 Cycle 2: Lobby system

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to get a login system and a game creation and lobby system implemented. I will attempt to make the process as frictionless as possible and ensure it is clear how to join or create a game. I'll need to establish some standardised system for communication with the server, and will need to ensure that I have appropriate "Game" and "Player" objects which can be manipulated and modified. There will also likely be a lot of boilerplate development required, wherein I will create methods and subroutines that will be used in later Cycles.

* [x] Implement a simple, frictionless login system - likely using Google OAuth
* [x] Create a lobby screen where users can see other players and switch roles
* [x] Create a game creation and joining system with game codes
* [x] Establish types and centralised subroutines where communication between the client and the server will occur

### Usability Features

* Bright colours used on buttons will ensure my game is easy to navigate and that all options are legible and visible
* A game code joining system is simple and does requires relatively development or user friction compared to a friend request system
* Signing in with Google creates a low barrier for entry and means that passwords don't need to be managed or secured by me.

### Key Variables

| Variable name     | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| socket.player     | Allows access to the corresponding player on every socket message. The player includes subroutines for dynamically editing data.                                                                                                                                                             |
| socket.game       | Allows access to the corresponding game on every socket message. This is useful, particularly if a user is requesting data about the game, as information can quickly be retrieved and sent                                                                                                  |
| \<SocketHandler/> | Technically this is a functional component, but it's useful enough to be included here. This acts as a wrapper for the client app, and ensures that received socket messages are handled appropriately and are accessible to other parts of the client                                       |
| gameAtom          | This is a piece of "state" on the client, which firstly allows relevant game data to be stored and accessed without having to send a request to the server, and secondly - as it is also cached in the browser - users will be able to quickly rejoin the game if they lose data connection. |

### Pseudocode

    code = request("POST", "/create", settings).body
    join_game(code)
end create_game

// These procedures will be called from UI elements, in various pages    
```

## Development

### Outcome

#### Server

The first 30 lines of this file handle JWT authentication. JWT stands for [JSON Web Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519), and its a standard for web-based user authentication. It allows for secure transfer and validation of identity information. Instead of creating a custom JWT system myself, which would take valuable time to develop  and configure, I decided to use a third party solution called [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). This allows me to quickly setup a "Login with Google" page, as well as providing useful client-side hooks (see:  [#client](2.2.2-cycle-2.md#client "mention")).

There are several "[middleware](https://socket.io/docs/v3/middlewares/)" functions - functions that get called at every request, and act as a buffer between client and server interaction. All the lines beginning with `io.use` are middleware functions. The two primary ones are:

* Line 66: This ensures that no user logged into the same account can connect twice
* Line 81: This handles game joining - if the game exists, it will append the game object and a new player object to the corresponding socket. This allows for easy access and interaction with the game and player at any socket listener.

Line 98 handles the core of socket interaction, and ensures that any socket requests are handled, and, if appropriate, new data is broadcasted to all other relevant sockets. This will likely need to be refactored at a later data, and moved into multiple files for clarity and readability.

	// Creates a new game and returns game joining code to client.
	const game = new Game(result.data.options);
	games.push(game);
	res.send(JSON.stringify({code: game.joinCode}));
});

const start = async () => {

void start();

	});
});
```
{% endcode %}

Below is the Player class, which contains information relevant to a specific player, and exposes a method called `updatePref` to easily update player type in both the player and game objects

{% code title="classes/player.ts" %}
```typescript
classes/export class Player {
	socket: Socket;
	game: Game;
	id: string;
	status: 'disconnected' | 'spectating' | 'alive';
	pref?: 'hunted' | 'hunter';
	type: 'hunted' | 'hunter';
	user: userType;
	isHost: boolean;

	constructor(socket: Socket, game: Game) {
		this.socket = socket;
		this.game = game;
		this.id = socket.user.sub;
		this.status = 'alive';
		this.pref = undefined;
		this.user = socket.user;
		// First player to join is host
		this.isHost = !game.players.length;
		// Gives player the type with the lowest number
		this.type = game.hunted.length > game.hunter.length ? 'hunter' : 'hunted';
		// Adds player to game game
		game.addPlayer(this);
	}
	
	// If the player wants their pref updated, call corresponding method on
	// server.
	updatePref(pref: 'hunted' | 'hunter') {
		this.pref = pref;
		this.type = this.game.updatePlayer(this.id, this.pref);
		return this.type;
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

Below is the Game class, which once again contains information relevant to the specific game, and exposes various methods:

* `addPlayer` allows a player to be added to a Game object, and allocates it to the class with the fewest players
* `updatePlayer` takes the preferred player type as its only parameter, and if possible, switches the player to its preferred type, or does not change the player's type. It returns the updated type of the player

Additionally, `generateJoinCode` is a procedure that will generate a random 6 character string of numbers and letters, to allow for a total of 36^6 combinations (over 2 billion). This will mean that  code collisions are incredibly unlikely.

{% code title="classes/game.ts" %}
```typescript
// Generates a random 6 character join code.
export const generateJoinCode = () => {
	const chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'.split('');
	return [...new Array(6)]
		.fill(0)
		.map(() => chars[Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length + 1)])
		.join('');
};

export class Game {
	id: string;
	creationTime: number;
	players: Player[];
	hunter: Player[];
	hunted: Player[];
	items: Item[]; // TBI
	host?: Player;
	hasStarted: boolean;
	joinCode: string;
	options: {
		max: {
			hunter: number;
			hunted: number;
			total: number;
		};
	};

	constructor(options: {max: {hunter: number; hunted: number}}) {
		// Configures game info, with random join code, and options
		// passed to above function
		this.id = uuid();
		this.creationTime = Date.now();
		this.players = [];
		this.hunter = [];
		this.hunted = [];
		this.items = this.generateItems(); //To be implemented
		this.hasStarted = false;
		this.joinCode = generateJoinCode();
		this.options = {
			max: {
				...options.max, 
				total: options.max.hunted + options.max.hunter
			},
		};
	}

	addPlayer(player: Player) {
		if (this.players.length === 0) {
			this.host = player;
		}
		if (this.players.length === this.options.max.total) return false;
		this.players.push(player);
		this.updatePlayer(
			player.id,
			this.hunter.length <= this.hunted.length ? 'hunter' : 'hunted'
		);
		return true;
	}

	updatePlayer(id: string, pref: 'hunter' | 'hunted') {
		const player = this.players.find(p => p.id === id);
		if (!player) throw new Error('Player not in game');
		const invertedPlayerPref = pref === 'hunter' ? 'hunted' : 'hunter';
		if (this[pref].length < this.options.max[pref]) {
			this[invertedPlayerPref] = this[invertedPlayerPref].filter(
				p => p.id !== id
			);
			this[pref].push(player);
			return pref;
		}
		return invertedPlayerPref;
	}

	start() {
		this.hasStarted = true;
		// TBI
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

#### Client

The primary entry point of the app contains a variety of "wrapper" components that provide app-wide functionality:

* `Auth0Provider` allows various parts of the app to trigger redirects to login pages, or, more importantly access the user's JWT token for authentication with the server.
* `ChakraProvider` is a UI framework that removes the need for external CSS-based stylesheets, as styles can be directly added to components, for instance:

```jsx
<Flex w={'full'} justifyContent={'center'} flexDir={'column'}/>
```

* `Toaster` is a component from a library called `react-hot-toast` that provides a simple system for displaying alerts and information popups on-screen
* `SocketHandler` - see below

{% code title="_app.tsx" %}
```jsx
const App = ({Component, pageProps}: AppProps) => {
	return (
		<Auth0Provider
			domain={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN!}
			clientId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID!}
			redirectUri={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ORIGIN}
			audience={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE}
			scope={'openid profile email'}
		>
			<ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
				<Toaster />
				<SocketHandler>
					<Component {...pageProps} />
				</SocketHandler>
			</ChakraProvider>
		</Auth0Provider>
	);
};

export default App;
```
{% endcode %}

This is primarily handler for receiving and processing data from the web socket connection. When users connect, disconnect or update, we call `setPlayers` which allows us to interact with some global state - variables that can be accessed anywhere throughout the client.

{% code title="components/SocketHandler.tsx" %}
```jsx
import {ReactElement, useEffect} from 'react';
import {useAtom} from 'jotai';
import {socketAtom} from '../utils/atoms';
import {usePlayers} from '../utils/hooks';
import {toast} from 'react-hot-toast';

export const SocketHandler = (props: {children: ReactElement | null}) => {
	const [socket, setSocket] = useAtom(socketAtom);
	const [, setPlayers] = usePlayers();

	useEffect(() => {
		(async () => {
			if (socket) {
				socket.on('user-connected', message => {
					setPlayers(users => [...users, message]);
				});
				socket.on('user-disconnected', message => {
					setPlayers(users => users.filter(user => user.id !== message.id));
				});
				socket.on('user-updated', ({type, data}) => {
					if (type !== 'type') return;
					setPlayers(users => [
						...users.filter(u => u.id !== data.id),
						{...users.find(u => u.id === data.id)!, type: data.type},
					]);
				});
				socket.on('connect_error', error => {
					toast.error(error.name);
					setPlayers([]);
					socket.disconnect();
					setSocket(null);
				});
				socket.on('disconnect', () => {
					setPlayers([]);
					setSocket(null);
				});
				return () => {
					socket.disconnect();
				};
			}
		})();
	}, [socket]);
	return props.children;
};

```
{% endcode %}

Lastly, this is the `ConnectWithCode` component, that behaves as a reusable wrapper for the /join and /create pages. It exposes a `connect` function to its children which allows them to initiate a connection to the socket, passing in the join code. The flow for game creation is very similar to the join flow - it simply creates the game and then joins it with the code received from the server.

{% code title="components/lobby/JoinOrCreateGame.t" %}
```jsx
export const CreatePage = () => {
	const {getIdTokenClaims} = useAuth0();
	// TBI
	const [options, setOptions] = useState({
		max: {
			hunter: 10,
			hunted: 10,
		},
	});

	return (
		<Flex alignItems={'center'} flexDir={'column'}>
			<GoBackButton />
			<Text>Settings for game setup</Text>
			<ConnectWithCode>
				{createGame => (
					<Button
						size={'lg'}
						colorScheme={'green'}
						onClick={async () => {
							const {code} = await fetcher<ServerResponses['code']>(
								'POST',
								'/create',
								getIdTokenClaims,
								{options}
							);
							await createGame(code);
						}}
					>
						Create
					</Button>
				)}
			</ConnectWithCode>
		</Flex>
	);
};


const ConnectWithCode = (props: {
	children(fn: (c: string) => Promise<void>): ReactElement;
}) => {
	const router = useRouter();
	const [, setGame] = useGame();
	const [, setPlayers] = usePlayers();
	const [socket, setSocket] = useAtom(socketAtom);
	const {getIdTokenClaims} = useAuth0();

	const connect = async (code: string) => {
		const token = await getIdTokenClaims();
		if (!token || socket) {
			await router.push('/');
			return;
		}
		const newSocket = connectToSocket(`localhost:8888`, token, {
			code,
		});

		const tempConnectedListener = async (game: ServerMessages['game-init']) => {
			setGame(game);
			setSocket(newSocket);
			newSocket.off('game-init', tempConnectedListener);
			await router.push('/');
		};

		newSocket.on('game-init', tempConnectedListener);

		newSocket.on('connect_error', error => {
			toast.error(error.message);
			newSocket.disconnect();
		});
	};

	return props.children(connect);
};
```
{% endcode %}

### Challenges

Seeing as this was a fairly substantial cycle, there were various challenges that needed to be overcome:

* **JWT + Websockets**: The official support for websockets from Auth0 was discontinued, but a community led replacement was available: [https://github.com/Thream/socketio-jwt](https://github.com/Thream/socketio-jwt), however it lacked adequate documentation, and repeatedly failed to work as expected with my app. After trawling through various forum posts I discovered the correct snippets that would allow be to authenticate correctly - it turned out that I was sending a shortened version of the token, and I needed to send the raw version, accessed with `token.__raw`. I also used [https://token.dev/](https://token.dev/) to determine whether the sent token was actually valid.
* **Game creation**: Initially I wanted all client-server communication to occur over a socket, however, when a user wants to create a game, it isn't possible for them to have a socket connection - every connected socket _must_ have a corresponding game. Additionally, the data that needed to be sent, was not feasible to be included in a connection header (unlike JWT tokens). I solved this by using a traditional HTTP endpoint (`/create`), which allowed a user to send an HTTP request to trigger a creation, and sent back a join code which they could use to initiate a connection.

## Testing

{% hint style="info" %}
An unexpected minor issue occurred while recording the evidence, where the "join code" was only 5 characters instead of 6. This is because my `generateJoinCode` function had a slight bug where it would occassionaly select an item at index 36, which was undefined (as lists have a start index of 0 in Javascript). I fixed this by removing the \
"+ 1" part of the function
{% endhint %}
