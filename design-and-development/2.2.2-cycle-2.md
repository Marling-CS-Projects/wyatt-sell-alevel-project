# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to get a login system and a game creation and lobby system implemented. I will attempt to make the process as frictionless as possible and ensure it is clear how to join or create a game. I'll need to establish some standardised system for communication with the server, and will need to ensure that I have appropriate "Game" and "Player" objects which can be manipulated and modified. There will also likely be a lot of boilerplate development required, wherein I will create methods and subroutines that will be used in later Cycles.

* [x] Implement a simple, frictionless login system - likely using Google OAuth
* [x] Create a lobby screen where users can see other players and switch roles
* [x] Create a game creation and joining system with game codes
* [x] Establish types and centralised subroutines where communication between the client and the server will occur

### Usability Features

* Bright colours used on buttons will ensure my game is easy to navigate and that all options are legible and visible
* A game code joining system is simple and does requires relatively development or user friction compared to a friend request system
* Signing in with Google creates a low barrier for entry and means that passwords don't need to be managed or secured by me.

### Key Variables

| Variable name     | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| socket.player     | Allows access to the corresponding player on every socket message. The player includes subroutines for dynamically editing data.                                                                                                                                                             |
| socket.game       | Allows access to the corresponding game on every socket message. This is useful, particularly if a user is requesting data about the game, as information can quickly be retrieved and sent                                                                                                  |
| \<SocketHandler/> | Technically this is a functional component, but it's useful enough to be included here. This acts as a wrapper for the client app, and ensures that received socket messages are handled appropriately and are accessible to other parts of the client                                       |
| gameAtom          | This is a piece of "state" on the client, which firstly allows relevant game data to be stored and accessed without having to send a request to the server, and secondly - as it is also cached in the browser - users will be able to quickly rejoin the game if they lose data connection. |

### Pseudocode

```
// Server
allGames = []
socketServer = new SocketServer()
webServer = new Webserver()

subroutine request_validator (data)
    validToken = data.token.validate()
    if (!validToken) new Error("Not logged in")
    if (data.code does not exist) new Error("No game for that code")
    
    allSockets = socketServer.all_sockets
    if (validToken.user exists in allSockets.users) 
        new Error("Duplicate connection")
    end if
end request_validator

subroutine webServer:/create (settings)
    game = new Game(settings)
    allGames.push(game)
    return game.code
end recieve:/create

subroutine socketServer:join_game (data)
    socket.player = new Player(data.user)
    socket.game = find game in allGames where data.code == game.code
end socketServer:join_game

// Server - Objects

    options: {
        max: {
            hunter: number;
            hunted: number;
            total: number;
        };
    };

}

// Client
procedure login
    redirect("external_google_login_page", () => {
        setToken(token)
        redirect("join_or_create_page")
    })
end procedure

// <SocketHandler>
subroutine recieve_server_message (data)
    if (data.type == "update_player") update_player(data)
    if (data.type == "player_disconnect") remove_player(data)
    if (data.type == "player_connect") add_player(data)
end recieve_server_message
// <SocketHandler/>

subroutine join_game (code)
    token = get_jwt_token()
    if (!token) redirect("login_page")
    
    socket = connect_to_socket(token, code)
    socket.listen("game-init", (data) => {
        gameAtom = data
        socketAtom = socket
        redirect("lobby_page")
    })
end join_game

subroutine switch_type (type) 
    const newType = socket.emit("switch-type", type).response
    update_players(newType)
end subroutine

subroutine create_game (settings)
    token = get_jwt_token()
    code = request("POST", "/create", settings).body
    join_game(code)
end create_game

// These procedures will be called from UI elements, in various pages
