# 2.2.8 Cycle 8: Item collection

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle, I will aim to allow picking up and dropping items, and a simple interface for players to see and interact with their items. I will also need to optimise item rendering, as loading all items to the screen causes significant performance issues (see [cycle-1-4.md](cycle-1-4.md "mention")). I hope to have a button to use the item, and a button to drop it. Coming within range of an item will trigger a "Pick up" button at the bottom of the screen, which will give an error if the user's inventory is full

* [x] Item inventory interface, with a list of items, and a description on each items individual page.
  * [x] A drop button which removes the item from the players inventory and adds it to the map
  * [x] A use button which triggers an items power (non-functional)
* [x] A "Pick up" item button which appears when an item is within range, and adds the item to the inventory, while removing it from the map.
* [x] Optimise item loading - potentially so players can only see items within a certain radius

### Usability

* If the user's inventory is full, the "Pick Up" button will appear red, with an error notification appearing if its clicked.
* An item's "use" button should be customised depending on its function - i.e. a GPS Jammer item would have the use button say "JAM GPS"
* ~~Make a blurry or otherwise interesting border around the player's item visibility range, to indicate that their may be more items beyond said boundary~~

### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use                                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| player.items  | A list which stores all items a player currently has in their inventory |
| items         | A list which stores all items currently on the map                      |

### Pseudocode

```
subroutine pickup_item(item, player)
    remove item from items array
    add item to player.items array
    send updated items to all players of same player.type
    send item_pickup message to player
end subroutine

subroutine drop_item(item, player)
    remove item from player.items array
    add item to items array
    send updated items to all players of same player.type
    send item_dropped message to player    
end subroutine
```

## Development

### Item rendering performance

Initially, I had planned to solve the problem of item rendering simply by decreasing the number of nodes displayed to the client. This solution was not ideal, and whilst debugging the item rendering component, I discovered that it was re-rendering almost 10 times a second.

I discovered this issue by logging a `rendered` message to the console when the component renders. To work out the cause of these rerenders, I used the "Flamegraph" function within React Dev Tools - it turned out to be down to a parent component re-rendering, and causing all of the children to also re-render.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A screenshot demonstrating the React Dev Tools profiler</p></figcaption></figure>

These extra re-renders were a huge performance hit, causing massively unnecessary computation. This was rectified by using what's known as a React Higher Order Component (HOC), called `React.memo`.

> _If your component renders the same result given the same props, you can wrap it in a call to `React.memo` for a performance boost in some cases by memoizing the result. This means that React will skip rendering the component, and reuse the last rendered result_.
>
> \-Â React.JS Docs ([https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo))

{% code title="React.memo usage" %}
```tsx
export const ItemMarkers = React.memo(
  (props: {items: Item[]; location: GeolocationCoordinates}) => {
    // Instead of using hooks, we pass in the item and location data as props, from
    // the parent component
    const {items, location} = props;

    if (!items || !location) return null;

    return (
      <>
        {items.map(item => <ItemComponent item={item}/>}
      </>
    );
  },
  (prev, next) => {
    // If this statement returns true (the previous props = the new props), then
    // the component will not rerender. We can improve performance when comparing
    // prev.items and next.items, by simply comparing the lengths of the lists, as
    // the actual item objects will not be mutated.
    return (
      prev.items.length === next.items.length &&
      prev.location.latitude === next.location.latitude &&
      prev.location.longitude === next.location.longitude
    );
  }
);
```
{% endcode %}

### "Pick up" button

In order to compute when to display a "Pick up" button, I iterated over each item to find the first one within a given distance. I also made sure to block item pickup if the user's inventory was full, and render a red background.

Otherwise, I would emit an `item-pickup` event to the server.

```tsx
export default () => {
    const [location, setLocation] = useLocation();
    const [items] = useItems();
    const me = useMe();
    ...
    const pickableItem = items?.find(i => distance(i.location, location) < 100);
    
    return (
        <MapContainer>
            ...
            {location && pickableItem && (
                <Button
                    onClick={() => {
                        if (me?.items?.length === 6) {
			    toast.error('Inventory full');
			} else {
			    socket?.emit('item-pickup', {id: pickableItem.id});
		        }
		    }}
		    colorScheme={me?.items?.length === 6 ? 'red' : 'green'}
		>Pick up</Button>
	    }
	    ...
	</MapContainer>
    )
}
```

On receipt of the `item-pickup` message by the server, several processes need to occur (see [#pseudocode](2.2.8-cycle-8-item-optimisation.md#pseudocode "mention")). We need to get the item by its id, append it to the player object, and remove it from the game object, before sending the updated data to the client.

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript">class Player {
    ...
  pickupItem(itemId: string) {
    // Return the item from game.items, and remove it from the game.items list
    const item = this.game.pickupItem(itemId);
    if (!item) return;
    // Add item to the player
<strong>    this.items.push(item);
</strong><strong>    // Send an 'item-pickup' confirmation to the requesting player
</strong>    this.socket.emit('item-pickup', {
      id: item.id,
    });
    // Send an 'item-remove' message to all *other* players of the same type, so 
    // their map remains in sync.
    this.socket.to(this.id + item?.info.type).emit('item-remove', {
      id: item.id,
<strong>    });
</strong>  }
  ...
}</code></pre>

Once these messages are received by the client, it mutates its local state within `SocketHandler.tsx` ([cycle-1-3.md](cycle-1-3.md "mention")), ensuring all client data is up-to-date.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="item-remove" %}
This removes the item from the game object, and hence, the map.

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript"><strong>setGame(prev => ({
</strong>    ...prev!,
    items: prev!.items.filter(i => i.id !== data.id),
}));</code></pre>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="item-pickup" %}
This message is received by the requesting player, confirming their request. The item is appended to their player, and removed from the map.

```typescript
const item = game?.items.find(i => i.id === data.id)!;
if (me) {
  setPlayers(prev => [
    ...prev.filter(p => p.id !== me.id),
    {...me, items: [...(me.items || []), item]},
  ]);
}
setGame(prev => ({
  ...prev!,
  items: prev!.items.filter(i => i.id !== data.id),
}));
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Inventory UI

The inventory UI was relatively painless to implement, using the [#ui-mockup](2.2.8-cycle-8-item-optimisation.md#ui-mockup "mention") as a rough reference, and a CSS grid structure, to ensure sensible wrapping and dimensions on a range of screen sizes.
