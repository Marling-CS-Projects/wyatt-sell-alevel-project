# 2.2.7 Cycle 7: Catching players

## Design

### Objectives

I concede that it seems strange to pivot from adding more item mechanics, to follow on from [cycle-1-4.md](cycle-1-4.md "mention"), however, there is a reason for it. Throughout the development I have started to realise that the scope of my project may have been too large, and my features proposed in [1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md "mention") are unlikely to be fully implemented. Therefore, I will implement the ability to catch players, and for a certain team to "win" the game. This will ensure that the game is playable, and could be presented as an MVP (minimum viable product). To achieve this, there are several things I intend to add:

* [ ] A game time setting in the creation page, which, once reached, will cause the game to end and the "Hunted" team to be declared victorious.
* [ ] A "Catch" screen should appear when a Hunter is within 5m of a player, which will cause the Hunted player _to become a spectator_
* [ ] The game should end and the Hunters declared victorious once all Hunted players are caught
* [ ] Improve item rendering performance

### Usability Features

* The game duration should be visible. I will change the game time indicator to a countdown
* There should be 10 minute, 5 minute and 1 minute countdown messages sent towards the end of the game
* The Catch button should be large and appear on top of the map
* When a game ends and a team wins, there should be alternate "You Win/Lose" message broadcast to players screens
