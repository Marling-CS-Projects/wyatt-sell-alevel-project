# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

When defining my success criteria in [1.5-success-criteria.md](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md "mention"), there were 2 targeted towards function and robustness. As my project has now concluded, it is appropriate to analyse whether I met these criteria.

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 15        | The game must not crash                                                                                                    |
| 17        | In-game actions, such as a player using, dropping or collecting an item should update immediately for all affected players |

### Criterion 15

In order to test for crashing I tried to press buttons in quick succession, decrease network speed and perform unusual actions, including:&#x20;

* Quickly toggling the the drone heatmap
* Changing location quickly
* Panning and recentering the map quickly

The game did not crash, but some visual artifacting did occur - in some cases the blur effect was removed from the map before the markers updated. This was only a difference of \~100ms, so is unlikely to cause any substantial issues.

I suspect the reason my game is relatively stable and does not crash is because a large amount of the computation is done on the server, and the client simply handles rendering and communication. This means that the game can run on low performance devices more easily

### Criterion 17

In-game actions update for all players functionally instantly - this includes location updates, item interactions and catching players. To benchmark the speed, I used Chrome DevTools to calculate the millisecond response time. The above flame-graph demonstrates this.

Admittedly the client and server are running on the same machine so there is no network bottleneck, however, I don't anticipate that external hosting would increase response times such that the game became unplayable or that updates would be substantially slower.
