# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

When defining my success criteria in [1.5-success-criteria.md](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md "mention"), I&#x20;

| Criterion                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The game must not crash                                                                                                    | This would ruin the sense of immersion, and leave the player with a bad experience                            |
| In-game actions, such as a player using, dropping or collecting an item should update immediately for all affected players | This ensures fairness for all players and would prevent different players being "out-of-sync" with each other |
|                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                               |
