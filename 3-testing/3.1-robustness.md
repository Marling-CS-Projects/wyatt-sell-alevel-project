## Criteria To Assess

Find success criteria that relate to function and robustness

| Criterion                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                   |

| The game must not crash                                                                                                    | This would ruin the sense of immersion, and leave the player with a bad experience                            |
| In-game actions, such as a player using, dropping or collecting an item should update immediately for all affected players | This ensures fairness for all players and would prevent different players being "out-of-sync" with each other |
|                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                               |
