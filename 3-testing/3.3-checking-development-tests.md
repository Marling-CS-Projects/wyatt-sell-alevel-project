# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

They could be plucked from the tests in your dev cycles, or be new tests that run the system as a whole.

## Evidence

Video evidence of the above tests
{% endembed %}

{% hint style="info" %}
An unexpected minor issue occurred while recording the evidence, where the "join code" was only 5 characters instead of 6. This is because my `generateJoinCode` function had a slight bug where it would occassionaly select an item at index 36, which was undefined (as lists have a start index of 0 in Javascript). I fixed this by removing the \
"+ 1" part of the function

## Evidence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost_3000_(iPhone 12 Pro) (2).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost_3000_(iPhone 12 Pro) (6).png>)

The first screenshot shows the game creation screen where the host can define the playable area. As shown in the image, there is no button to create a polygon, only to edit and delete, once the first one has been created.

The second screenshot shows the in-game screen:

- At the footer, the username, game-time and role are displayed. There are also two currently non-functional buttons in preparation for later functionality.
- The recenter button (visible in both) is in the bottom right, easy to reach and will pan the map with an animation after pressing
- There is an example popup above the red indicator showing details about the player when their indicator is clicked
- At the very top, there is an alert triggered as soon as the other player moved out of bounds

| 4    | (Within Game) Observe item distribution | The rarities and types are appropriately distributed (noticeably) | The distribution is too subtle and seems random   | Fail      |

{% hint style="danger" %}
Although not an explicit test, the game rendered and ran incredibly slowly, with location changes taking several seconds to be reflected on-screen. I suspect this is due to unnecessary re-rendering of the entire items array, as well as the costly re-computation of item distances. I will fix this next Cycle as it is a non-trivial fix.
{% endhint %}

### Failing Tests

#### Test 2

There doesn't appear to be a great way to rectify this issue - it lies with the efficiency of the algorithm (a respectable O(n)), which can't handle generating millions of evenly distributed items. This could be rectified by using simple random generation, but would result in the caveats discussed earlier.

I think the simplest solution is to reject a game creation with an error if the bounding area is too large. In future, I could experiment with "just-in-time" generation, generating items within a certain area around players, and restricting the panning and zooming on the map (similarly to [#pokemon-go](../1-analysis/1.3-research-the-problem.md#pokemon-go "mention"))

```typescript
app.post('/create', (req, res) => {
...
    const {width, height} = dimensions(result.data.options.vertices);
    // If the game is more than 30km^2, return an error
    if (width * height > 30 * 1000 ** 2) {
        return res.status(400).send(JSON.stringify({data: 'Map is too large'}));
    }
...
});
```

#### Test 4

I rectified this by multiplying the distribution variable by a constant in the `typesToSelect` list, to increase the disparity in probabilities and modified the `rarityArr` element ratio from 3:2:1, to 9:3:1

<pre class="language-typescript" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-typescript">const typesToSelect = types[type].flatMap(type =>
<strong>    Array(10 - type.baseRarity * 3).fill(type)
</strong>) as typeof types['hunter' | 'hunted'];

const item = typesToSelect[Math.floor(Math.random() * typesToSelect.length)];

const rarityArr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3].filter(v => v >= item.baseRarity)</code></pre>

The two above images show the Catch button, and the "Caught" message that appears before the caught player is returned to the Create/Join page.

{% hint style="info" %}
The issue with the leaving being instant and the message not being displayed was fixed by trigger the socket disconnection from the client - the issue stemmed from the client exiting the game the instant the socket disconnected.

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript">toast.error(`You were caught! Game Over`);

{% hint style="info" %}
Although not explicitly a test, when adding a second player and clicking "Switch Role", the items would be incorrect for their role when the game started. To rectify this, I created a new socket message called `game-update`, allowing me to update the entire item array on the client, similarly to the `game-init` event.

I called this from within the `player.updatePref()` method, sending the items appropriate for the players new role to the client.
