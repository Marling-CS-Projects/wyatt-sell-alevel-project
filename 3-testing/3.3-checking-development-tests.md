# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

## 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

They could be plucked from the tests in your dev cycles, or be new tests that run the system as a whole.

## Cycle 1

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                  | What I expect                                                              | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Visit http://locahost:3000                    | A simple UI is displayed with a list of messages received from the server. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Visit localhost:3000, and observe server logs | A "Client connected message" is logged to the console.                     | As expected           | Pass      |

### Evidence

Video evidence of the above tests
{% endembed %}

{% hint style="info" %}
An unexpected minor issue occurred while recording the evidence, where the "join code" was only 5 characters instead of 6. This is because my `generateJoinCode` function had a slight bug where it would occassionaly select an item at index 36, which was undefined (as lists have a start index of 0 in Javascript). I fixed this by removing the\
"+ 1" part of the function

The first screenshot shows the location view all players will see of themselves - a blue dot with a translucent circle displaying their accuracy.

The second screenshot is an example of what a hunter might see, with their fellow teammates rendered in as the red circle, and their location rendered in blue.

### Evidence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_(iPhone 12 Pro) (2).png>) ![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_(iPhone 12 Pro) (6).png>)

The first screenshot shows the game creation screen where the host can define the playable area. As shown in the image, there is no button to create a polygon, only to edit and delete, once the first one has been created.

The second screenshot shows the in-game screen:

* At the footer, the username, game-time and role are displayed. There are also two currently non-functional buttons in preparation for later functionality.
* The recenter button (visible in both) is in the bottom right, easy to reach and will pan the map with an animation after pressing
* There is an example popup above the red indicator showing details about the player when their indicator is clicked
* At the very top, there is an alert triggered as soon as the other player moved out of bounds

The first screenshot shows the UI if a user disconnects from a game, where the user can decide to leave the game for good, or to rejoin.

The second screenshot shows the current in-game UI with the new font, as well as the notification that will appear when a user leaves a game.
