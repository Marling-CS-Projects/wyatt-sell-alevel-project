# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

In order to assess the game's feasibility I created a series of criteria which I will collect feedback on from a small group of users once they have played the game.

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you feel this game would encourage you to be more active? Do you feel that this game requires you to problem solve and think critically?      |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are buttons easy to find? Can you find how to use, drop and pickup an item? Is it easy to pan and zoom in the map?                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you enjoy playing the game? Do you like the game's interface and style?                                                                       |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game lag when you play it? Do you encounter any bugs or glitches, and if so what are they?                                              |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Is it easy to understand how to play the game? Do you feel you understand what each item does? Is it obvious how to pickup, drop and use items?  |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | The map contains a variety of items are visible to many players |
