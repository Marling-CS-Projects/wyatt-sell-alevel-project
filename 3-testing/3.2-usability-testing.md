# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

In order to assess the game's feasibility I created a series of criteria which I will collect feedback on from a small group of users once they have played the game.

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you feel this game would encourage you to be more active? Do you feel that this game requires you to problem solve and think critically? |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are buttons easy to find? can you find how to use, drop and pickup an item? Is it easy to pan and zoom in the map?                          |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you enjoy playing the game? Do you like the game's interface and style?                                                                  |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game lag when you play it? Do you encounter any bugs or glitches, and if so what are they?                                         |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Do                                                                                                                                          |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description           |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| X         | describe the critiera |
