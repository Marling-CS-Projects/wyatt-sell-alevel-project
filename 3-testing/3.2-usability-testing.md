# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

In order to assess the game's feasibility I created a series of criteria which I will collect feedback on from a small group of users once they have played the game.

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you feel this game would encourage you to be more active? Do you feel that this game requires you to problem solve and think critically?      |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are buttons easy to find? Can you find how to use, drop and pickup an item? Is it easy to pan and zoom in the map?                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you enjoy playing the game? Do you like the game's interface and style?                                                                       |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game lag when you play it? Do you encounter any bugs or glitches, and if so what are they?                                              |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Is it easy to understand how to play the game? Do you feel you understand what each item does? Is it obvious how to pickup, drop and use items?  |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Overwhelming respondents strongly agreed that the game would encourage them to be more active, one of the primary goals for my game. This showed that the game was suitably fun to galvanise people to exercise

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The results from this question were not as positive as I had hoped, with a significant minority of players responding "Neutral" when asked about the problem solving and critical thinking skills my game needed. I think this is due to the small number of items in the game, and the lack of some mechanics discussed in [1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md "mention"). If the timeframe allowed for more features, then I believe the results would be more positive.

That's not to say that it was a failure however, with over 60% of respondents either Agreeing or Strongly Agreeing.

#### Question 3

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All respondents "Strongly Agreed" that buttons were clear and easy to find. This shows that my design system decided in [1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md "mention") and its implementation was a success - meaning that my game will be legible and easy to play for older gamers.

#### Question 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question was fairly successful, with all respondents answering either Agree or Strongly Agree. The majority only answered Agree, meaning there is some UX work to be done - it's not immediately clear how to access the inventory for instance. This could be solved with a tutorial or walkthrough, in the future, but given the responses, this would be low priority.

#### Question 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was similarly answered to the above question with a 50/50 split between Agree and Strongly Agree. However, I don't think the responses warrant additional development as all users tested my game on a mouse based interface, whereas in practice it would played on a phone. Google Maps has identical controls and does not include hints, indicating that my UX is suitable.

#### Question 6

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Everyone enjoyed playing the game, which means it was suitably engaging and fun.

#### Question 7

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Everyone liked the game's interface, however the responses tended more towards a neutral response than in Question 6, meaning that although positive it wasn't particularly notable. I'd like to lean more into the "hacker" aesthetic discussed in [1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md "mention"), however it wouldn't be high priority due to overall positive feedback and would require careful UX considerations.

#### Question 8

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

No-one reported any lagging meaning my item optimisations in [2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md "mention") were successful, and the game was fully playable. This response may be different if the server and client were hosted on different devices - for testing, they were on the same laptop.

#### Question 9

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

During usability testing, the majority of users did not encounter any bugs (62.5%), however a significant minority encountered "only one". These should be fixed as a high priority in future. The bugs are as follows:

* An intermittent runtime error after game competition - this has a minimal affect on usability, but is a negative experience for the user after the game is over. This should be fixed in future.
* When a drone heat-map is active, and another drone heat-map is activated, the old heat-map UI is retained. This is a fairly minor bug, but in future I would like to refactor the "EffectsOverlay" component to better handle effect messages, and fix this.

#### Question 10

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another overall positive response, but due to the lack of "Strongly Agree" responses, there is still work to be done in the form of a tutorial or hints for the user.

#### Question 11

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All users agreed that they understood what each item did, and minimal improvements will need to be made.

#### Question 12

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question is very similar to [#question-4](3.2-usability-testing.md#question-4 "mention"), however it asks about how "easy to learn" my item system is vs how "efficient" it is. All users responded with either Agree or Strongly Agree, and little work needs to be done here in additional to the improvements discussed in Question 4.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5         | Players should be able to _easily_ view and interact with their items                               |
| 9         | Alerts or item feedback (i.e. drones, public appeals), should be clear, large and easy to interpret |
| 11        | All gameplay elements need to be legible and usable on a typical smartphone (iPhone 6)              |
| 13        | There should be an easy way to define boundaries and playtime                                       |
| 14        | Players should be able to create an account and join a game easily and quickly                      |

### Criterion 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All users agreed that it was easy to view and interact with their items, meaning that Criterion 5 was successfully met.

### Criterion 9

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As above, all users agreed that alerts were clear, large and easy to interpret, meaning the Criterion 9 was successfully met.

### Criterion 11

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All users agreed that all gameplay elements were clear and legible, with a larger proportion answering "Strongly Agree" than in previous questions, hence Criterion 11 was very successfully implemented and met.

### Criterion 13

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Most users agreed that it was easy to define boundaries and playtime, with one user answering "Neutral" to the question. I have to say I agree that the boundary creation could be improved as its not immediately intuitive how to initially define boundaries to a new-coming player. The feedback given for this question supports my hypothesis, and although, due to the majority of respondents answering Agree, I successfully met Criterion 13, there is still work to be done in future development,

### Criterion 14

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All users agreed that it was quick and easy to create an account and join a game, meaning that Criterion 14 was successfully implemented.
