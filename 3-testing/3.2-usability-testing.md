# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

In order to assess the game's feasibility I created a series of criteria which I will collect feedback on from a small group of users once they have played the game.

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you feel this game would encourage you to be more active? Do you feel that this game requires you to problem solve and think critically?      |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are buttons easy to find? Can you find how to use, drop and pickup an item? Is it easy to pan and zoom in the map?                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you enjoy playing the game? Do you like the game's interface and style?                                                                       |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game lag when you play it? Do you encounter any bugs or glitches, and if so what are they?                                              |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Is it easy to understand how to play the game? Do you feel you understand what each item does? Is it obvious how to pickup, drop and use items?  |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

#### Question 1

Overwhelming respondents strongly agreed that the game would encourage them to be more active, one of the primary goals for my game. This showed that the game was suitably fun to galvanise people to exercise

#### Question 2

The results from this question were not as positive as I had hoped, with a significant minority of players responding "Neutral" when asked about the problem solving and critical thinking skills my game needed. I think this is due to the small number of items in the game, and the lack of some mechanics discussed in [1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md "mention"). If the timeframe allowed for more features, then I believe the results would be more positive.

That's not to say that it was a failure however, with over 60% of respondents either Agreeing or Strongly Agreeing.

#### Question 3

All respondents "Strongly Agreed" that bu

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5         | Players should be able to _easily_ view and interact with their items                               |
| 9         | Alerts or item feedback (i.e. drones, public appeals), should be clear, large and easy to interpret |
| 11        | All gameplay elements need to be legible and usable on a typical smartphone (iPhone 6)              |
| 13        | There should be an easy way to define boundaries and playtime                                       |
| 14        | Players should be able to create an account and join a game easily and quickly                      |
