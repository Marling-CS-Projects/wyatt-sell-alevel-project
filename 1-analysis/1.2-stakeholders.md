# 1.2 Stakeholders

### Shine TV

Shine TV is the production company responsible for producing Hunted. It is primarily owned by Elisabeth Murdoch. Typically media production companies outsource video game production to game studios, with an arranged revenue agreement.

### Older gamers

As discussed in [1.1-problem-identification.md](1.1-problem-identification.md "mention"), my game will primarily target gamers over 50. This is because older people make up the majority of TV viewership in the UK ([Statista, 2010](../reference-list.md)), and are most at risk of cognitive decline ([Murman, 2015](../reference-list.md)).&#x20;

According to a survey of "Baby Boomer" gamers, they often reported that they felt there was a _lack of attention to their demographic and interests by the game industry._ This indicates a gap in market for a game that is tailored to the wants and needs of olde gamers, specifically games that _provide enough of an intellectual challenge_ ([Perse and Rubin, 1990](../reference-list.md)).

### PEGI

PEGI (Pan-European Game Information), is an age rating system for European video games. It is supported by the major console manufacturers: Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, and is used by parents when determining what games are appropriate. As my target audience is over 50s, these age ratings are unlikely to have an impact, however, if I wanted to release "Hunted: The Game", more widely, I would nonetheless have to obtain a valid age rating.

On consulting the PEGI label guide, it seems that a rating of **PEGI 7** would be most appropriate for my game - there is a very small level of threat, and my game may potentially include sounds that may be alarming to a young child - a police siren, for example.

_Game content with scenes or sounds that can possibly be frightening to younger children should fall in this category. Very mild forms of violence (implied, non-detailed, or non-realistic violence) are acceptable for a game with a PEGI 7 rating._ ([PEGI, 2017](../reference-list.md))
