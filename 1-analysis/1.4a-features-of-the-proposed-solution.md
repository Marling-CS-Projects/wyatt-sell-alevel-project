# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Overview

My game will be a live multiplayer geolocation game, based off the "Hunted" TV Show, and following a manhunt style format. It will involve exploring and travelling in the real world, improving physical fitness, as well as improving mental ability through a variety of item mechanics and puzzles. There would be two teams, Hunters and Hunted:

* Hunters would have to co-ordinate and organise with each other, and have certain mechanics that facilitated this, for example, public appeals, and being able to each other on a map
* Hunted players would act solo, and have to collect items to help them evade capture. They would only be able to see themselves on a map.

As discussed later, both players would have certain items that they could see and collect, which would give them new powers beneficial to their respective "team". For instance, Hunters could use drones to survey the nearby area, and Hunted players could use GPS jammers to disrupt the maps of nearby Hunters.

The items system would be similar to that of other popular geolocation games (i.e. [#pokemon-go](1.3-research-the-problem.md#pokemon-go "mention")), where items appear on your screen only when they are nearby. This would also serve to increase the exercise benefits of my game.

## Mechanics

### Hacking Puzzles

This would be feature only available to the Hunters, where there are able to solve brain puzzles in order to "hack" someone they are hunting, and get intelligence about their probable location. The hunters would only be able to "hack" at certain "bases" around the map. These could be predefined or randomly generated.

* **Vigenère cipher**: The player would have to find a cipher key that is is <10 letters related to their location - for instance if they were on "Horns Road", the cipher key could be horn. This would show the Hunter the sector and direction of the nearest "Hunted" player
* **Sudoku**: The player would have to solve a fairly difficult Sudoku puzzle in order to gain information about the players "rough" geographically quadrant (square)
* **Firewall maze escape**. You have to trace a path through a randomly generated maze, to escape the "firewall". If you get to the end, you'll see an arrow in the direction of the nearest player.

### Power-up items

Different items would be available depending on what player you were:

#### Hunters

* **Phone triangulation**: If the hunter finds a phone triangulation kit, they will have to travel to the nearest cell tower (pulled from [Opencellid](https://opencellid.org/)), to obtain a triangulation vector for any chosen player. The hunted players would have the functionality to "turn their phone off", but they would be unable to use any of their items, interact with anything, or see where they were
* **Drones**: If a hunter finds a drone, they can "deploy" it in a certain bearing and it will display the live virtual heat signatures of nearby players - there will be some false positives implemented, to make the item more balanced. It will also have a cooldown time, and Hunters will need to return to a "base" if they want to recharge the drone and use it again. There will be an audible hum audible to nearby players when a drone is flying overhead.
* **Virtualized "public appeal"**: Hunters will as a team have 2 "public appeal" buttons for the entire game. In order to use them, there must be majority approval from the Hunters. This will result in location reports occurring depending on how close the person being Hunted is to a road/urban environment. The location reports are guaranteed to be accurate. There will be a significant delay before the person being Hunted is aware of their public appeal.

#### Hunted

* **Foil blanket:** If a player finds this item they will be able to equip it, in order to avoid drone detection. If a drone is flying nearby, you will not appear on the heat signature map. This item will not be able to be used at the same time as a disguise.
* **GPS Jammer:** If a hunted player finds a GPS player on the ground they will be able to use it for a short period of time. This will scramble the GPS map display of any hunters or hunted players of all players nearby (including the player using the jammer). This will confuse and disorient  the Hunters as well as hindering their team co-ordination.
* **Disguise**: A disguise is a very rare item which would allow the Hunted players to make a public appeal ineffective. It would stop all location reports, and would mean that the Hunters have wasted one of their public appeals. Per game, there would likely be only one or two of these items in the entire map.
* **Stingray:** Similarly to the disguise this is the rarest and most powerful item for Hunted players. It will make a ticking noise, and the frequency of the ticks will represent the proximity of a Hunter (similar to a Geiger counter, in sound). It will only be useable when the player is standing still, and there will only be one in the whole game.

### Item interactions

* **Nearby items**: Items that are close to the player will appear on the map, with an icon indicating what they are. A player will have to walk within 3m of the item and click "Pick up" in order to collect the item.
* **Backpack Space**: Depending on game settings, there will be a limit to the number of items a player can carry at any one time. If a player wants to collect a new item, they will first have to "drop" another item.
  * **Dropping Items**: A player can choose to drop any item in their backpack at any time. This will result in the item appearing on the map for all players of the same class, and could allow for item exchanges (in addition to new items being collected if the players backpack is full).
* **Item Level**: Items will have different levels depending on how powerful they are, for instance, a Level 2 GPS Jammer will last longer and have a greater range than a Level 1 GPS Jammer. Items with a higher level have a lower chance of spawning on the map and are therefore rarer. You can also merge items:
  * **Merging items**: If a player finds two items that are the same level (i.e. two Level One GPS Jammers), when they are collecting the second jammer, a "Merge" button will appear, so the player can choose to have two Level One items, or one Level Two item. This merging mechanic will extend through all possible items levels.

### Catching players

If a Hunter comes within 5m of a Hunted player, a large "CAPTURE" button will fill the screen of the Hunter and if clicked, the Hunted player will be out of the game, and will be able to spectate the Hunters. The reason that I am choosing to add an extra step to catching a player, is to give the Hunted player a chance to run away. If the Hunter comes within 5m of a Hunted player and fails to capture them:

* The location of the Hunted player will be broadcast to all other Hunters
* The name of the Hunter who failed to capture the other player will be broadcast to all other Hunters (this is to prevent cheating)

{% hint style="info" %}
I will likely include a "Trustworthy" mode, which would mean that the Hunted player would have to concede to being captured. This would be useful if for instance, the Hunted player was hiding and not visible, although within 5m.
{% endhint %}

### Miscellaneous

#### Hunted

* **Turning off your phone**: This will prevent Hunters from being able to triangulate your location, however you will not be able to see the map, your location, or use any of your non-equipable items.

#### Game setup

* **Defining play area**: When the game is initially setup, the hosting player will be able to define the area allowed for gameplay - this will be shown to all players so that they don't stray out of bounds. Some gamemodes could also harness this feature and shrink the playable area, as time progresses

## User Interface

My game will comprise primarily of a map, with the bottom of the screen displaying a footer with information like game time and distance covered, as well as buttons to access or equip your items, settings, and other misc. options.

![Mockup of "Hunter" interface (Figma)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png>)

Above is a mockup of what the interface will likely look like. Your location will be centered on the map, with a red dot indicating your position if you are being Hunted. If you are a Hunter, your location will be marked with a green dot, and nearby hunters will be highlighted in blue. One will be able to zoom in and out of the map, and items that are within the semi-transparent, outer location circle will be indicated with corresponding icons on the map.

In the white footer at the bottom of the phone, buttons and text are large, making it easier to read and tap for my target audience:

**Text**

* In-game name
* Player "class" - Hunter or Hunted
* Game duration

**Buttons**

* Backpack access
* Settings/other options

### Design Language

#### Main Interface

My app will be light mode, as it's been shown that black on white text is more legible, for all ages ([Piepenbrock et al., 2013](../reference-list.md)), furthermore, as my target audience is over-50s, so will be more likely to have degraded eyesight as a result of age-related degeneration ([Muñoz, 2000](../reference-list.md)). As mentioned above, buttons will be large and clear, further facilitating my target audience which often struggles with fine-motor control ([Smith et al., 1999](../reference-list.md)). Making the buttons larger, therefore, will ensure that more people are able to play and enjoy my game.&#x20;

Where possible, large photo-realistic icons will be used instead of text, as the icons will be able to be more legible where space for text is limited - i.e. buttons on a phone screen.

#### Fonts

![Share Tech Mono (Google Fonts)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (2).png>)

I've chosen to go with a monospaced font, as my game features a large amount of hacking or computer-based gadgetry. Monospaced fonts are used often in computer interfaces and software development, making them a good fit for this project.

I've also decided to choose a font with very little smoothing and sharp, aggressive edges. This adds to the aesthetic of a game revolving around a manhunt - tension is high, and an aggressive font would add to that tense atmosphere.

### Backpack system

When the user clicks on their backpack, a screen should appear with all your items visible. You should be able to click on each item, and buttons will popup so you are able to interact with that item. I want to implement some kind of 3D display for items, similar to Pokémon Go:

{% embed url="https://sketchfab.com/models/13e8f92c93004b37a7603a521b2507cf/embed" %}
Military GPS 3D Model by eline.meils
{% endembed %}

The 3D item will appear in the top half of the screen, and buttons to perform actions with that item will appear in the bottom half:

* Drop the item
* Merge the item with another of the same level - this will only appear if another item is in your backpack
* Use the item - in the case of a GPS jammer, the button would be "Jam", however with a equipable item, the button would be "Equip"

There would also be additional information associated with the item, for instance:

* Remaining cooldown duration
* Item level

## Limitations

### No Augmented Reality

Augmented reality is a technology that is used in many real-life geolocation games, and could have utility in my game as way to see items in the real world. However, adding this feature would require a significant time investment, would not be supported on all devices and the gameplay improvement is minimal

### No In-Game Communication

Teamwork within the Hunter team is integral to effective and fun gameplay -  if the Hunters work well together, they are much more likely to catch a Hunted player. A strong communication system is therefore needed, however, I believe there are abundant other communication platforms, which are freely available. Implementing my own communication system, would once again require a significant time investment, and&#x20;

### Platform Support

My game will be web-based, as I'm most familiar with web technologies (Javascript, React, etc.), and many APIs that were traditionally only available for native apps, now have web equivalents (i.e. Geolocation, Bluetooth, etc.). Building a web-based app allows for support on a wider range of devices, and strong cross-compatibility. You will be able to add the game to your homescreen and use it similarly to an app, meaning that for most users it will be indistinguishable from a native app.
