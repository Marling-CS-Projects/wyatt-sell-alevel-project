# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Hacking Puzzles

This would be feature only available to the Hunters, where there are able to solve brain puzzles in order to "hack" someone they are hunting, and get intelligence about their probable location. The hunters would only be able to "hack" at certain "bases" around the map. These could be predefined or randomly generated.

* **Vigen√®re cipher**: The player would have to find a cipher key that is is <10 letters related to their location - for instance if they were on "Horns Road", the cipher key could be horn. This would show the Hunter the sector and direction of the nearest "Hunted" player
* **Sudoku**: The player would have to solve a fairly difficult Sudoku puzzle in order to gain information about the players "rough" geographically quadrant (square)
* **Firewall maze escape**. You have to trace a path through a randomly generated maze, to escape the "firewall". If you get to the end, you'll see an arrow in the direction of the nearest player.

### Power-up items

Different items would be available depending on what player you were:

#### Hunters

* **Phone triangulation**: If the hunter finds a phone triangulation kit, they will have to travel to the nearest cell tower (pulled from [Opencellid](https://opencellid.org/)), to obtain a triangulation vector for any chosen player. The hunted players would have the functionality to "turn their phone off", but they would be unable to use any of their items, interact with anything, or see where they were
* **Drones**: If a hunter finds a drone, they can "deploy" it in a certain bearing and it will display the live virtual heat signatures of nearby players - there will be some false positives implemented, to make the item more balanced. It will also have a cooldown time, and Hunters will need to return to a "base" if they want to recharge the drone and use it again.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
