# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Hacking Puzzles

This would be feature only available to the Hunters, where there are able to solve brain puzzles in order to "hack" someone they are hunting, and get intelligence about their probable location. The hunters would only be able to "hack" at certain "bases" around the map. These could be predefined or randomly generated.

* Sudoku: The player would have to solve a fairly difficult Sudoku puzzle in order to gain information about the players "rough" geographically quadrant
* Vigen√®re cipher: The player would have to find a cipher key that is is <10 letters related to their location - for instance if they were on "Horns Road", the cipher key could be horn. This would show the Hunter the sector and direction of the nearest "Hunted" player
