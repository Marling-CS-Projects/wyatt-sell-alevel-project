# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Hacking Puzzles

This would be feature only available to the Hunters, where there are able to solve brain puzzles in order to "hack" someone they are hunting, and get intelligence about their probable location. The hunters would only be able to "hack" at certain "bases" around the map. These could be predefined or randomly generated.

* **Vigenère cipher**: The player would have to find a cipher key that is is <10 letters related to their location - for instance if they were on "Horns Road", the cipher key could be horn. This would show the Hunter the sector and direction of the nearest "Hunted" player
* **Sudoku**: The player would have to solve a fairly difficult Sudoku puzzle in order to gain information about the players "rough" geographically quadrant (square)
* **Firewall maze escape**. You have to trace a path through a randomly generated maze, to escape the "firewall". If you get to the end, you'll see an arrow in the direction of the nearest player.

### Power-up items

Different items would be available depending on what player you were:

#### Hunters

* **Phone triangulation**: If the hunter finds a phone triangulation kit, they will have to travel to the nearest cell tower (pulled from [Opencellid](https://opencellid.org/)), to obtain a triangulation vector for any chosen player. The hunted players would have the functionality to "turn their phone off", but they would be unable to use any of their items, interact with anything, or see where they were
* **Drones**: If a hunter finds a drone, they can "deploy" it in a certain bearing and it will display the live virtual heat signatures of nearby players - there will be some false positives implemented, to make the item more balanced. It will also have a cooldown time, and Hunters will need to return to a "base" if they want to recharge the drone and use it again. There will be an audible hum audible to nearby players when a drone is flying overhead.
* **Virtualized "public appeal"**: Hunters will as a team have 2 "public appeal" buttons for the entire game. In order to use them, there must be majority approval from the Hunters. This will result in location reports occurring depending on how close the person being Hunted is to a road/urban environment. The location reports are guaranteed to be accurate. There will be a significant delay before the person being Hunted is aware of their public appeal.

#### Hunted

* **Foil blanket:** If a player finds this item they will be able to equip it, in order to avoid drone detection. If a drone is flying nearby, you will not appear on the heat signature map. This item will not be able to be used at the same time as a disguise.
* **GPS Jammer:** If a hunted player finds a GPS player on the ground they will be able to use it for a short period of time. This will scramble the GPS map display of any hunters or hunted players of all players nearby (including the player using the jammer). This will confuse and disorient  the Hunters as well as hindering their team co-ordination.
* **Disguise**: A disguise is a very rare item which would allow the Hunted players to make a public appeal ineffective. It would stop all location reports, and would mean that the Hunters have wasted one of their public appeals. Per game, there would likely be only one or two of these items in the entire map.
* **Stingray:** Similarly to the disguise this is the rarest and most powerful item for Hunted players. It will make a ticking noise, and the frequency of the ticks will represent the proximity of a Hunter (similar to a Geiger counter, in sound). It will only be useable when the player is standing still, and there will only be one in the whole game.

### Item interactions

* **Nearby items**: Items that are close to the player will appear on the map, with an icon indicating what they are. A player will have to walk within 3m of the item and click "Pick up" in order to collect the item.
* **Backpack Space**: Depending on game settings, there will be a limit to the number of items a player can carry at any one time. If a player wants to collect a new item, they will first have to "drop" another item.
  * **Dropping Items**: A player can choose to drop any item in their backpack at any time. This will result in the item appearing on the map for all players of the same class, and could allow for item exchanges (in addition to new items being collected if the players backpack is full).
* **Item Level**: Items will have different levels depending on how powerful they are, for instance, a Level 2 GPS Jammer will last longer and have a greater range than a Level 1 GPS Jammer. Items with a higher level have a lower chance of spawning on the map and are therefore rarer. You can also merge items:
  * **Merging items**: If a player finds two items that are the same level (i.e. two Level One GPS Jammers), when they are collecting the second jammer, a "Merge" button will appear, so the player can choose to have two Level One items, or one Level Two item. This merging mechanic will extend through all possible items levels.

### Catching players

If a Hunter comes within 5m of a Hunted player, a large "CAPTURE" button will fill the screen of the Hunter and if clicked, the Hunted player will be out of the game, and will be able to spectate the Hunters. The reason that I am choosing to add an extra step to catching a player, is to give the Hunted player a chance to run away. If the Hunter comes within 5m of a Hunted player and fails to capture them:

* The location of the Hunted player will be broadcast to all other Hunters
* The name of the Hunter who failed to capture the other player will be broadcast to all other Hunters (this is to prevent cheating)

### Miscellaneous

#### Hunted

* **Turning off your phone**: This will prevent Hunters from being able to triangulate your location, however you will not be able to see the map, your location, or use any of your non-equipable items.

## User Interface

My game will comprise primarily of a map, with the bottom of the screen displaying a footer with information like game time and distance covered, as well as buttons to access or equip your items, settings, and other misc. options.

![Mockup of "Hunter" interface (Figma)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

Above is a mockup of what the interface will likely look like. Your location will be centered on the map, with a red dot indicating your position if you are being Hunted. If you are a Hunter, your location will be marked with a green dot, and nearby hunters will be highlighted in blue. One will be able to zoom in and out of the map, and items that are within the semi-transparent, outer location circle will be indicated with corresponding icons on the map.

In the white footer at the bottom of the phone, buttons and text are large, making it easier to read and tap for my target audience:

**Text**

* In-game name
* Player "class" - Hunter or Hunted
* Game duration

**Buttons**

* Backpack access
* Settings/other options

### Design Language

My app will be light mode, as it's been shown that black on white text is more legible, for all ages ([Piepenbrock et al., 2013](../reference-list.md)), furthermore, as my target audience is over-50s, so will be more likely to have degraded eyesight as a result of age-related degeneration ([Muñoz, 2000](../reference-list.md)). As mentioned above, buttons will be large and clear, further facilitating my target audience which often struggles with fine-motor control ([Smith et al., 1999](../reference-list.md)). Making the buttons larger, therefore, will ensure that more people are able to play and enjoy my game.&#x20;

Where possible, large photo-realistic icons will be used instead of text, as the icons will be able to be more legible where space for text is limited - i.e. buttons on a phone screen.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
