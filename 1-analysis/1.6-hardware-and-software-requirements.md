# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

In order to program and develop my game, I will need a text editor, a runtime environment, and a compiler. I will also require a suitable browser in order to test my game. I'm choosing to use the two most popular browsers for iOS and Android, Safari and Chrome ([Statcounter, 2022](../reference-list.md)) respectively, to ensure a similar experience independent of your device.

| Webstorm 2022.1                 | <ul><li>Any modern multi-core CPU</li><li>8GB of RAM</li><li>5GB Free disk space (SSD preferred)</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Node.js + TSC                   | <p>This is highly variable, depending on libraries used and program size. However, below is the minimum hardware to have a "good" experience:</p><ul><li>Any modern CPU</li><li>4GB of RAM</li><li>10GB Free disk space</li></ul>                                              |
| Google Chrome + Safari (mobile) | <p>Again, this is highly dependant on many other factors, like tabs/other apps open, however, here are some rough markers:</p><ul><li>A modern smartphone CPU</li><li>2GB of RAM (Android only)</li><li>35/156MB Free disk space (usually redundant as preinstalled)</li></ul> |

## User Requirements

Users will require a modern mobile browser, (and mobile OS) in order to play my game. This means it will need to support both Safari and Chrome (as discussed in [#development-requirements](1.6-hardware-and-software-requirements.md#development-requirements "mention")). Players will also need a device with GPS and audio output (speakers or headphones). They will need a device that runs a modern mobile OS version, likely iOS 10+, and Android 6+

| Safari   | <ul><li>iOS 10 and up</li><li>RAM: N/A - iPhone's typically don't require as much RAM for their operation, and my game is unlikely to be extremely RAM intensive</li><li>35MB Free disk space (usually preinstalled)</li></ul> |
