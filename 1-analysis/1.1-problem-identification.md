# 1.1 Problem Identification

Over the past few years, we've seen television viewership in the elderly increase - with over 75s watching the highest proportion per day - an average of 371 minutes (Statista, 2010). This is a significant problem - television has been shown to overall decrease elderly viewers morale, perceived respect and an increased level of concern for ones wellbeing (Rahtz, Sirgy and Meadow, 1989). On the other hand, Grajczyk (1998) suggests that television could be _a ‘window to the outside world’ for people with little opportunity for direct, unmediated social contact, thus possibly raising their satisfaction of life,_ however he also states that prolonged use could further demonstrate a feeling of loneliness or neglect.

To summarise, there is a substantial amount of evidence that television use in the elderly is relatively high compared to other age groups, and that on balance the drawbacks of excessive television consumption outweigh its benefits. However, if the narrative structure of a television programme was preserved, or even amplified, in the form of a video game, there is a strong possibility that this would mitigate the negatives of television consumption, and amplify the positives.

As mentioned, there is evidence to suggest television consumption is correlated with a need for social contact, but in my view, it falls short in this regard:

* Television is a one way medium - the viewers have no interaction or genuine connection with the people onscreen.
* Consumption of television is a passive endeavour - there is minimal mental activity required to watch television.
* There are very few tangible benefits to watching television for a long period of time, apart from slight mitigation against loneliness.
* Old people watch lots of TV

* Hunted is a popular TV show, so a game based upon it will likely attract a large user base
