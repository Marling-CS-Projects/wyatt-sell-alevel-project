# 1.1 Problem Identification

Over the past few years, we've seen television viewership in the elderly increase - with over 75s watching the highest proportion per day - an average of 371 minutes ([Statista, 2010](../reference-list.md)). This is a significant problem - television has been shown to overall decrease elderly viewers morale, perceived respect and an increased level of concern for ones wellbeing ([Rahtz, Sirgy and Meadow, 1989](../reference-list.md)). On the other hand, [Grajczyk (1998)](../reference-list.md) suggests that television could be _a ‘window to the outside world’ for people with little opportunity for direct, unmediated social contact, thus possibly raising their satisfaction of life,_ however he also states that prolonged use could further demonstrate a feeling of loneliness or neglect.

To summarise, there is a substantial amount of evidence that television use in the elderly is relatively high compared to other age groups, and that on balance the drawbacks of excessive television consumption outweigh its benefits. However, <mark style="background-color:orange;">if the narrative structure of a television programme was preserved, or even amplified, in the form of a video game, there is a strong possibility that this would mitigate the negatives of television consumption, and lead to significant benefits.</mark>

As mentioned, there is evidence to suggest television consumption is correlated with a need for social contact, but in my view, this need could be far better met via a video game:

* Television is a one way medium - the viewers have no interaction or genuine connection with the people onscreen.

_Media use may become a substitute for personal interaction. Some media compensate or substitute for reduced personal interaction for the chronic lonely_ ([Pearce 1990](../reference-list.md)). Pearce also states that television consumption can aid in social connection - i.e. talking about the same television show, however, a more recent survey seem to indicate the same is true for "Baby Boomers" who play video games - Baby Boomers ... _are looking for a fun play experience in a socially supportive environment_ ([Pearce, 2008](../reference-list.md)). I think its arguable that video games are a far better social outlet for people, especially for creating social connections and friendships - there is a decidedly two way relationship between players.

* Consumption of television is a passive endeavour - there is minimal mental activity required to watch television (and minimal benefit)

As we age, our brains naturally start to decline in efficiency and function ([NIH, 20](../reference-list.md)17), as the parts of our brains associated with learning and memory begin to shrink or decay. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that this decline is worsened by consumption of television, particularly with regard to verbal memory ([Fancourt, 2019](../reference-list.md)). In contrast, video games, _particularly strategy games,_ have been unequivocally shown to be beneficial to mental health ([Adachi and Willoughby, 2013](../reference-list.md), [Jones et al., 2014](../reference-list.md), [Granic, Lobel and Rutger C. M. E. Engels, 2014](../reference-list.md)), and in some cases reverse the effects of cognitive decline, causing dramatic improvements in _task switching, working memory, visual short term memory, and mental rotation._ ([Basak et al., 2008](../reference-list.md), [Glass, Maddox and Love, 2013](../reference-list.md))

Unfortunately, despite the well researched benefits of video games, and the negative impacts of television consumption, over 65s still watch TV for dramatically longer than they play video games.

I believe this can be changed, by utilising a familiar show - Hunted, and replicating the mechanics and entertainment of the show into a video game. There are several reasons for doing this:

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Hunted

Hunted is a British reality television programme, where contestants "go on the run" for 25 days, attempting to evade "law enforcement" (Hunters). The Hunters are equipped with "the powers of the state", including CCTV, ANPR (automatic number plate recognition) and call tracing abilities. The contestants must survive for the full 25 days, making it to an extraction point in order to win a £100,000 prize.\

If adapted into a video game, the mechanics and gameplay would likely consist of a fusion of RPG, Strategy and Battle Royale genres
{% endhint %}

* Older people, the target audience of my game, find it more difficult to adapt to new situations ([Salleh, 2016](../reference-list.md), [Matamales et al., 2016](../reference-list.md)). By adapting a show (and its mechanics), they may find my game easier to understand and play.
* Hunted is an already immensely popular television show ([IMDb, 2015](../reference-list.md), [BARB, 2018](../reference-list.md)), so it's likely that a large proportion of viewers would also be interested in a video game based on the shows premise.
* Role-playing and strategy games are not only great for improving cognitive ability ([Adachi and Willoughby, 2013](../reference-list.md)), but are also popular amongst Boomers ([Pearce, 2008](../reference-list.md)), and the wider population ([Perrin, 2018](../reference-list.md)) who cite roleplaying and adventure games as being their favourite genres. Additionally, strategy, role playing and Battle Royale games are the 3 highest grossing game genres ([Katkoff et al., 2019](../reference-list.md)), so a combination of mechanics from these games is likely to generate a large profit if monetised.

* A video game would have the potential to avoid the drawbacks and criticisms of its TV show counterpart. For example, a common criticism of the show, as [Adam Postans (2015](../reference-list.md)) writes is that "_About half of what it says is happening actually isn’t, from its disclaimer: “For the purposes of this series, some powers of state have been replicated, including CCTV and ANPR”._ This, as Postans goes on to say, means the more astute viewers are unable to become immersed in the show, as  it generates too many questions about how these surveillance techniques are able to be replicated. A video game doesn't have this issue, as everything in a video game is "emulated". It can replicate CCTV technology without criticism, as the entire game is virtual - there is no claim that it is "real life".
