# 1.1 Problem Identification

Over the past few years, we've seen television viewership in the elderly increase - with over 75s watching the highest proportion per day - an average of 371 minutes ([Statista, 2010](../reference-list.md)). This is a significant problem - television has been shown to overall decrease elderly viewers morale, perceived respect and an increased level of concern for ones wellbeing ([Rahtz, Sirgy and Meadow, 1989](../reference-list.md)). On the other hand, [Grajczyk (1998)](../reference-list.md) suggests that television could be _a ‘window to the outside world’ for people with little opportunity for direct, unmediated social contact, thus possibly raising their satisfaction of life,_ however he also states that prolonged use could further demonstrate a feeling of loneliness or neglect.

To summarise, there is a substantial amount of evidence that television use in the elderly is relatively high compared to other age groups, and that on balance the drawbacks of excessive television consumption outweigh its benefits. However, <mark style="background-color:orange;">if the narrative structure of a television programme was preserved, or even amplified, in the form of a video game, there is a strong possibility that this would mitigate the negatives of television consumption, and lead to significant benefits.</mark>

As mentioned, there is evidence to suggest television consumption is correlated with a need for social contact, but in my view, this need could be far better met via a video game:

* Television is a one way medium - the viewers have no interaction or genuine connection with the people onscreen.

_Media use may become a substitute for personal interaction. Some media compensate or substitute for reduced personal interaction for the chronic lonely_ ([Pearce 1990](../reference-list.md)). Pearce also states that television consumption can aid in social connection - i.e. talking about the same television show, however, a more recent survey seem to indicate the same is true for "Baby Boomers" who play video games - Baby Boomers ... _are looking for a fun play experience in a socially supportive environment_ ([Pearce, 2008](../reference-list.md)). I think its arguable that video games are a far better social outlet for people, especially for creating social connections and friendships - there is a decidedly two way relationship between players.

* Consumption of television is a passive endeavour - there is minimal mental activity required to watch television (and minimal benefit)

As we age, our brains naturally start to decline in efficiency and function ([NIH, 20](../reference-list.md)17), as the parts of our brains associated with learning and memory begin to shrink or decay. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that this decline is worsened by consumption of television, particularly with regard to verbal memory ([Fancourt, 2019](../reference-list.md)). In contrast, video games, _particularly strategy games,_ have been unequivocally shown to be beneficial to mental health ([Jones et al., 2014](../reference-list.md), [Granic, Lobel and Rutger C. M. E. Engels, 2014](../reference-list.md)), and in some cases reverse the effects of cognitive decline, causing dramatic improvements in _task switching, working memory, visual short term memory, and mental rotation._ ([Basak et al., 2008](../reference-list.md), [Glass, Maddox and Love, 2013](../reference-list.md))



* Hunted is a popular TV show, so a game based upon it will likely attract a large user base

* Battle Royale + Strategy + RPG are very successful genres, so why not combine them?
