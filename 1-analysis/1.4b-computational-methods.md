# 1.4b Computational Methods

Computational Thinking is a collection of technique used to solve problems with a computer algorithm. It involves analysing a problem, and working out the optimal and most future-proof way it can be represented in computer code. This is incredibly important for large programming projects such as my game, and the reasons are outlined below:

* Data needs to be shared and communicated across multiple devices in realtime. This will rely on a computers ability to handle multiple concurrent streams of data, and interact between them.
* A user needs to have a clear UI with "items" overlayed onto the real world. A computer program is needed here as it is not possible or feasible to have physical, working items in specific locations.
* Various in-game items and actions will need to be simulated as they are not ethical to be done in real-life. This will rely on a computer program that is able to simulate GPS jamming, drone flight, and/or hacking
