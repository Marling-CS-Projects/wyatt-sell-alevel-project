# 1.4b Computational Methods

Computational Thinking is a collection of technique used to solve problems with a computer algorithm. It involves analysing a problem, and working out the optimal and most future-proof way it can be represented in computer code. This is incredibly important for large programming projects such as my game, and the reasons are outlined below:

* Data needs to be shared and communicated across multiple devices in realtime. This will rely on a computers ability to handle multiple concurrent streams of data, and interact between them.
* A user needs to have a clear UI with "items" overlayed onto the real world. A computer program is needed here as it is not possible or feasible to have physical, working items in specific locations.
* Various in-game items and actions will need to be simulated as they are not ethical to be done in real-life. This will rely on a computer program that is able to simulate GPS jamming, drone flight, and/or hacking

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is the process of removing unnecessary or irrelevant information in order to simplify a problem or interface. This will be especially useful in my game, as it needs to be simple and understandable for my target audience. My game needs to provide a challenge, but it must be clear what to do or what the next steps are:

* **Removing Street and Business Names:** Google's Satellite Map displays an excess of information, much of which will be irrelevant and even detract from gameplay. Business names and icons for instance are parts of the map which are not integral to gameplay and will only crowd the screen, and distract from the indications of icons for in-game items. Furthermore, street signs will be removed in order to increase team communication, and to ensure that certain mechanics remain unaffected (see [#hacking-puzzles](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#hacking-puzzles "mention"))
* **"Hacking" Interfaces or Puzzles:** My game will not be able to feature actual hacking or penetration testing simulations, due to it be inaccessible and too complex for the vast majority of people, young and old. Therefore, my game will include problems that rely on maths and problem solving, to simulate the kind of thinking required for real-life hacking.
