# 1.4b Computational Methods

Computational Thinking is a collection of technique used to solve problems with a computer algorithm. It involves analysing a problem, and working out the optimal and most future-proof way it can be represented in computer code. This is incredibly important for large programming projects such as my game, and the reasons are outlined below:



## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation



## Thinking Ahead

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

## Thinking Logically

## Thinking Concurrently
