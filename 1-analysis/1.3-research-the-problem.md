## Booyah!

![Booyah Promotional Screenshots (Play Store, 2019)](<../.gitbook/assets/New Project.png>)

Booyah is a real life hide and seek game that users install as an app on their phone, and use it to amplify their hide and seek experience. It includes a matchmaking lobby, and features a range of game modes that will play sounds on the hiders phones depending on the game mode selected (i.e. if the hider moves too quickly, their phone will emit a loud sound in the "Slow & Steady" game mode). The game doesn't appear to feature any form of GPS or geolocation.

The actions users can do in-game do not appear to be very complex or interesting - the extend of in-game player actions is the seeker shaking their phone, in order to sound an alarm on the hiders phones. The game also encourages the seeker to wear a blindfold, in order for the game to be suitably tense, and for all the players to be in an enclosed space.

### Controls

Booyah! doesn't appear to feature a large amount of in game control - your main objective is to move away from the seeker without them being alerted to your presence via your phone's alarm. The mechanics behind alarm triggering appear to vary slightly depending on game mode:

* Hand Ninjas: The hiders phone's will alarm at regular intervals, and they have to u**nlock their phone to disable the alarm** - their phone must start in their pocket
* Timer Dash: You are only allowed to move while the alarm on your phone is sounding
* Slow and Steady: If the hiders move to quickly, their phone's alarm will sound
* Marco Polo: The seeker can **shake their phone** to trigger an alarm on all hiders phones, but the hiders are free to move

As indicated above, the only controls available are shaking, or unlocking your phone

### User Interface

Booyah! features a cartoon-esque design language with bright colored buttons

### Technical Implementation

The game appears to communicate with other players in the same game over the internet, seeming to indicate a client-server architecture.

* **Joining a game:** Booyah! uses a "Room ID" system, which is shown on the game host's phone. The other players enter the Room ID on the join game screen and shortly afterwards, a screen showing other players in their game appears - the joining user also appears on the screen of other players waiting in the lobby. I don't have access to the Booyah! codebase, but some assumptions can be made about how this is likely to operate or could be replicated:
  * Room IDs are all stored in a central database, and generated randomly - there is likely additional logic to ensure ID conflicts are avoided
  * These Room IDs are stored along with a list of users currently connected to the same lobby
  * When a user connects, an HTTP request is sent to the server, along with the entered room ID. The room ID is validated, and the user is appended to the list of users in that lobby.
  * The server responds with a list of users currently connected.
  * Pings are probably sent at regular intervals to detect when a user disconnects - if the server doesn't receive a ping for x seconds, remove the user from the lobby and broadcast the new player list to the remaining players
* **In Game Alarms**: Players alarms can sound in different ways depending on the game mode. I think its reasonable to assume that for some game modes, a client-server model is likely, and for others, the alarm triggering is probable to be done client-side. For example:
  * Slow and Steady: In this mode, players alarms will sound if _they_ move to quickly - the phones accelerometer is measured and therefore the app's code has a threshold by which it will trigger the alarm. No communication with a server is necessary
  * Other modes: In other modes some communication with the server is likely, for example _Marco Polo -_ in this mode an alarm is triggered when the seeker shakes their phone. Once again, the app likely has a detection threshold using the phones gyroscope, but this time, an HTTP request is sent to the server, along with the Room ID. The server will then use the provided Room ID to send a HTTP request/socket message to the hiders, telling the app to use their phones speaker to trigger an alarm.

| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Matchmaking via a Room ID                | It is a simple and familiar way for users to join the same game, without having to implement a friend/invite based system                                                        |
| Sounding alarms with the phone's speaker | Hunters could find/work to get a power up that allows them to sound the alarm of the nearest "hunted" player                                                                     |
| A variety of different game modes        | This prevents boredom by introducing additional mechanics to seasoned players, as well as attracting a wider player base - different game modes will appeal to different players |
| Client-Server model                      | This is a much simpler system to implement than a peer to peer system, and it only relies on an internet connection, not, for instance, bluetooth proximity and/or connectivity. |

| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shaking the phone         | Not a very difficult or interesting mechanic. It also excludes a large part of my target audience (over 50s) who are likely to have reduced motor skills.   |
| Horror/Frightening sounds | This is not necessary to the gameplay, and horror is not the atmosphere I'm trying to create with my game. It could also contribute to a higher age rating. |

## Pokemon Go

![Pokémon Go in-app screenshots (Skipper, 2016)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)

Pokémon Go is a location-based, augmented reality game that allows you to travel around in the real world and "catch" Pokémon in specific geographical locations. There are other features on the map including "PokéStops" where players can collect special items which will help them in their catching endeavors, or even train their Pokémon, to improve their battle abilities. There also appears to be significant multiplayer capabilities including "Trainer Battles", which involves battling to other players that are in proximity to you. Niantic later introduced a "Battle League", which allows for online battles with players around the world. The game also features a cartoon-style map, which resembles the real world, and in some cases, will feature notable real-world locations, like churches, or museums. ([Lopez, 2016](../reference-list.md), [Porter, 2019](../reference-list.md))

The game seems to be primarily about single-player hunting, and doesn't appear to feature any massive multiplayer battles or different game-modes.

### Controls

Pokémon Go is almost entirely controlled by your real life location and movement. For instance, there may be Pokémon in nearby locations which you need to physically walk towards in order to have the chance to catch. Once you are near to the Pokémon, an augmented reality screen will appear where you can attempt to catch the Pokémon using your camera to see it in your physical environment.

**Add more here**

### User Interface

Pokémon Go is comprised primarily of a map that resembles the real world. It's not clear exactly where the data to generate the map originates, and it seems that the games developer Niantic is quite cagey about this. A lot of elements in the map are user submitted, like gyms or PokéStops, which correspond to notable physical locations - like a supermarket or park bandstand.

### Technical Implementation

Tech is cool and that
