## Booyah!

![Booyah Promotional Screenshots (Play Store, 2019)](<../.gitbook/assets/New Project.png>)

Booyah is a real life hide and seek game that users install as an app on their phone, and use it to amplify their hide and seek experience. It includes a matchmaking lobby, and features a range of game modes that will play sounds on the hiders phones depending on the game mode selected (i.e. if the hider moves too quickly, their phone will emit a loud sound in the "Slow & Steady" game mode). The game doesn't appear to feature any form of GPS or geolocation.

The actions users can do in-game do not appear to be very complex or interesting - the extend of in-game player actions is the seeker shaking their phone, in order to sound an alarm on the hiders phones.

### Controls

Booyah! doesn't appear to feature a large amount of in game control - your main objective is to move away from the seeker without them being alerted to your presence via your phone's alarm. The mechanics behind alarm triggering appear to vary slightly depending on game mode:

* Hand Ninjas: The hiders phone's will alarm at regular intervals, and they have to u**nlock their phone to disable the alarm** - their phone must start in their pocket
* Timer Dash: You are only allowed to move while the alarm on your phone is sounding
* Slow and Steady: If the hiders move to quickly, their phone's alarm will sound
* Marco Polo: The seeker can **shake their phone** to trigger an alarm on all hiders phones, but the hiders are free to move

As indicated above, the only controls available are shaking, or unlocking your phone.
