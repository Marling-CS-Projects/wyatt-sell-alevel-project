American Fugitive is a third-person top down, 3D game involving crime and car chases. The game appears to follow a mission based gameplay arc, and is set in the US deep South in the 1980s. The game seems to include a large amount of violence including running people over, killing police officers with a range of weapons, and assaulting civilians.
