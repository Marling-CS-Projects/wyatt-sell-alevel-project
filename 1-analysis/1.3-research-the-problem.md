### Overview

American Fugitive is a third-person top down, 3D game involving crime and car chases. The game appears to follow a mission based gameplay arc, and is set in the US deep South in the 1980s. The game seems to include a large amount of violence including running people over, killing police officers with a range of weapons, and assaulting civilians. The aim is to continually avoid capture whilst committing a range of petty offences in the meantime.&#x20;

Driving seems to form the majority of this game, with the player completing tasks and avoiding **capture. There does not appear to be any multiplayer elements at all, and the in-game characters feel as if theyâ€™ve been picked at random from a stockroom of American stereotypes, and the writing fails to enliven them.**
