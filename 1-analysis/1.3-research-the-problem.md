## Booyah!

![Booyah Promotional Screenshots (Play Store, 2019)](<../.gitbook/assets/New Project.png>)

Booyah is a real life hide and seek game that users install as an app on their phone, and use it to amplify their hide and seek experience. It includes a matchmaking lobby, and features a range of game modes that will play sounds on the hiders phones depending on the game mode selected (i.e. if the hider moves too quickly, their phone will emit a loud sound in the "Slow & Steady" game mode). The game doesn't appear to feature any form of GPS or geolocation&#x20;
