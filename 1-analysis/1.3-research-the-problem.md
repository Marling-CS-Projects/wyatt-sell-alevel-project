### Overview

American Fugitive is a third-person top down, 3D game involving crime and car chases. The game appears to follow a mission based gameplay arc, and is set in the US deep South in the 1980s. The game seems to include a large amount of violence including running people over, killing police officers with a range of weapons, and assaulting civilians. The aim is to continually avoid capture whilst committing a range of petty offences in the meantime.&#x20;

Driving seems to form the majority of this game, with the player completing tasks and avoiding capture. There does not appear to be any multiplayer elements at all, and the in-game characters feel _as if they’ve been picked at random from a stockroom of American stereotypes, and the writing fails to enliven them_ ([Iwaniuk, 2019](../reference-list.md)). The graphics are attractive and complex, but it doesn't feel good enough to redeem the bland gameplay and story.

### Controls

The game is supported on most consoles, and allows for a range of controls, such as:

* Console gamepads (Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch)
* Mouse and keyboard

In order to effectively control your player you must have adequate dexterity and co-ordination to operate dual controller at the same time for movement as well as operating triggers and buttons to perform other actions. This is not ideal for my target audience of over 50s, as their reaction times are unlikely to be appropriate for American Fugitive ([Müller-Oehring et al., 2013](../reference-list.md))
