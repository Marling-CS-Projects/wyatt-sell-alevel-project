| 1        | The map contains a variety of items are visible to many players                                     | Players should be competing against each other - a common item map will help this.                                                                                  | <ul><li><a data-mention href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#item-interactions">#item-interactions</a>                                                         |</li></ul>                                         |
| 2        | Players should be able to collect and drop items                                                    | This will allow players to interact and switch out the items contained in their inventory. It could also facilitate trading and teamwork                            | <ul><li><a data-mention href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#item-interactions">#item-interactions</a></li></ul><p></p>                                                                                            |
| 3        | Players should be able to merge items of the same level                                             | This will allow for different rarities of items to be generated, and will facilitate trading and hunting for items                                                  | <ul><li><a data-mention href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#item-interactions">#item-interactions</a></li></ul>                                                                                                   |
| 4        | Hunter players should be able to see each other on the map                                          | This facilitates teamwork between Hunters and allows for better co-ordination.                                                                                      | <ul><li><a data-mention href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface">#user-interface</a></li></ul>                                                                                                         |
| 5        | Players should be able to view and interact with their items                                        | This primarily ensures players can easily use items they have collected. It also enables them to prioritise which items to look out for or collect next             | <ul><li><a data-mention href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#power-up-items">#power-up-items</a></li></ul>                                                                                                         |
| 6        | Hunters should be able to complete mini-games or puzzles to reveal information about Hunted players | This is a core feature that will improve mental ability as well as providing a gameplay element that emulates the computer-based reconnoissance seen on the TV show | <ul><li><a data-mention href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#hacking-puzzles">#hacking-puzzles</a></li><li><a data-mention href="1.1-problem-identification.md">1.1-problem-identification.md</a></li></ul><p></p> |
| 7        | Hunters should be able to capture Hunted players quickly and easily                                 | This will reflect the actual ease of capture seen in the TV show, where all the Hunter needs to do is "tag" the Hunted player.                                      | <ul><li><a data-mention href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#catching-players">#catching-players</a></li></ul>                                                                                                     |
| 8        |                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 22       | In-game actions, such as a player using, dropping or collecting an item should update immediately for all affected players | This ensures fairness for all players and would prevent different players being "out-of-sync" with each other |           |
