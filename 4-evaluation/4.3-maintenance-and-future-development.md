# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Item variety** - There are only two items currently implemented, with only one per player.
* **Hacking puzzles** - There are no built in puzzles or mini-games, limiting my game's critical thinking requirements
* **More complex item interactions** - There's no support for equipping an item or merging items.
* **Graphics** - There aren't currently any item graphics or icons.
* **Tutorials** - There is no walkthrough functionality and minimal instructions or information for items and mechanics.
* **Misc features** - No "turning off your phone", or spectator functionality.

I will assess these limitations in future development cycles and decide how or whether to implement additional functionality.

## Maintenance

My game will require separate strategies depending on the direction I want to take my project in. I will assess whether it makes sense to maintain my current (small) feature-set or to expand functionality and potentially introduce more bugs.

#### Current Size

The [#short-term-bug-fixes](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md#short-term-bug-fixes "mention") details my development workload and plan if I were to mostly focus on maintenance and my game were to remain largely in its current form. To ensure that my game is playable and ready for release, I will focus primarily on fixing bugs, and implementing a tutorial or walkthrough system, to enable new players to learn the game. However, most of the features described in [#current-limitations-of-project](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md#current-limitations-of-project "mention"), will not be addressed as do not have a significant impact on usability.

The size of my codebase can be healthily maintained by me, assuming its size remains remains relatively constant. If I wanted to better market my game's release or handle licensing with [#shine-tv](../1-analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#shine-tv "mention"), I would likely need to bring another person with more experience in marketing or licensing onboard. Hosting would be handled by deployment on [Hop.io](https://hop.io), a hosting platform optimised for the socket and realtime focus of my game. I would need to ensure adequate resources hence performance, but minimal maintenance of hosting infrastructure would be required by me.

My game's code is hosted on GitHub, and currently I intend for my codebases to remain closed source. This is in order to protect the potential to explore monetisation in the future.
