# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Item variety** - There are only two items currently implemented, with only one per player.
* **Hacking puzzles** - There are no built in puzzles or mini-games, limiting my game's critical thinking requirements
* **More complex item interactions** - There's no support for equipping an item or merging items.
* **Graphics** - There aren't currently any item graphics or icons.
* **Tutorials** - There is no walkthrough functionality and minimal instructions or information for items and mechanics.
* **Misc features** - No "turning off your phone", or spectator functionality.

I will assess these limitations in future development cycles and decide how or whether to implement additional functionality.

## Maintenance

My game will require separate strategies depending on the direction I want to take my project in. I will assess whether it makes sense to maintain my current (small) feature-set or to expand functionality and potentially introduce more bugs.

#### Current Size

The [#short-term-bug-fixes](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md#short-term-bug-fixes "mention") details my development workload and plan if I were to mostly focus on maintenance and my game were to remain largely in its current form. To ensure that my game is playable and ready for release, I will focus primarily on fixing bugs, and implementing a tutorial or walkthrough system, to enable new players to learn the game. However, most of the features described in [#current-limitations-of-project](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md#current-limitations-of-project "mention"), will not be addressed as do not have a significant impact on usability.

The size of my codebase can be healthily maintained by me, assuming its size remains remains relatively constant. If I wanted to better market my game's release or handle licensing with [#shine-tv](../1-analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#shine-tv "mention"), I would likely need to bring another person with more experience in marketing or licensing onboard. Hosting would be handled by deployment on [Hop.io](https://hop.io), a hosting platform optimized for the socket and real-time focus of my game. I would need to ensure adequate resources hence performance, but minimal maintenance of hosting infrastructure would be required by me.

My game's code is hosted on GitHub, and currently I intend for my codebases to remain closed source. This is in order to protect the potential to explore monetization in the future.

#### Room for Growth

Before new features can be implemented, the short term development plan would need to be implemented as this would fix bugs and performance issues, as well as refactoring the codebase to allow for better clarity, maintainability and hence extendibility. Following this, I will evaluate the  [#current-limitations-of-project](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md#current-limitations-of-project "mention") to determine the new features I need to add and what an ideal finished game would look like.

As long as I maintain a coherent and readable code structure, I don't anticipate needing to introduce more developers in the short to medium term. However, if the scope of my project expands or I want to add more complex functionality, more developers may be needed. I would need to onboard them onto the project, but by following good file structure and maintaining readable code, I anticipate this would be a fairly quick process.

In the spirit of my game (teamwork and collaboration), I would likely crowdsource many feature suggestions and bug reports, by creating a forum or implementing a bug report form. This would enable a more stable game, and inform me of previously unknown issues, as well as ensuring my testing was even more comprehensive.

If my game's popularity grew, and many feature requests and bug reports were created, I would likely need to hire separate developers to handle different parts of the game, as well as developers specialized in creating rigorous, programmed unit tests. Hopefully through this process, each developer would become well-versed in their part of the codebase, and very unique or specific bugs could be addressed quickly and easily, allowing for new features to be created, with collaboration between the relevant developers, to rapidly grow my game.

## Future Development

### Short Term Plan

#### Bug Fixes

Before any other modifications, any existing bugs in my game need to be addressed - even minor issues, as they could become more profound as a result of future development. Below is a list of bugs, and how anticipate fixing them:

* _The game host encounters a runtime exception after the game has has ended_ _(intermittently)_: I was unable to replicate this issue, given it behaves intermittently, so more testing is needed to determine its cause.
* _If one uses a drone search while another is still active, the new drone search overlay will not be displayed_: To fix this, I would (temporarily) reverse the effects array in the EffectsOverlay component so that the most recent effect is the one rendered.
* _On the create screen, the Create button is not fully visible_: To fix this, I would style the map container to grow to fit available visible space within the viewport using CSS, and ensure that the button and input elements had fixed heights.
* _The Catch button does not disappear when a user leaves a game_ - To fix this, I would check to see who is currently able to catch the disconnecting player and send a `player-catch-off` message to them.
*   _When a user disconnects and reconnects:_

    * _Their items don't appear in their inventory_
    * _Messages like "game-end" are not received_
    * _The game time is not displayed correctly (00:00)_
    * _Effects continue if the user was disconnected when the effect was supposed to wear off._\
      __

    To fix this, I will convert the local item and effect states to be retained in the browser after a refresh. When the user reconnects I will also make sure to update their player object with their new socket connection, as well as queuing any messages that were intended for the disconnected player, to send when they reconnect.

**Codebase Restructuring**

**Semantics**

The values `hunter` and `hunted` **** having only a one letter difference means that typos can cause significant issues. In order to fix this, I intend to rename hunter and hunted (internally!), to `catcher` and `hider`. No change will be made to how the names are displayed to the players, given the TV show theme, but this will allow for more readable and less error-prone development. Additionally, I intend to replace the `type` string value on each player with an `isHider` boolean value to simplify player type checking.

**General Refactoring**
