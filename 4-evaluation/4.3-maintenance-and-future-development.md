# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Item variety** - There are only two items currently implemented, with only one per player.
* **Hacking puzzles** - There are no built in puzzles or mini-games, limiting my game's critical thinking requirements

* **Graphics** - There aren't currently any item graphics or icons.
* **Tutorials** - There is no walkthrough functionality and minimal instructions or information for items and mechanics.
* **Misc features** - No "turning off your phone", or spectator functionality.
