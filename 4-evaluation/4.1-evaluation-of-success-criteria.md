## Mechanics

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                         | When was it achieved |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | The map contains a variety of items are visible to many players                                     | Cycle 6 & 7          |
| 2         | Players should be able to collect and drop items                                                    | Cycle 8              |
| 3         | Players should be able to merge items of the same level                                             | Not achieved         |
| 4         | Hunter players should be able to see each other on the map                                          | Cycle 3              |
| 5         | Players should be able to view and interact with their items                                        | Cycle 8 & 9          |
| 6         | Hunters should be able to complete mini-games or puzzles to reveal information about Hunted players | Not achieved         |
| 7         | Hunters should be able to capture Hunted players quickly and easily (when nearby)                   | Cycle 7              |
| 8         | There should be a clear way to see what items you have equipped, and to remove or change them       | Not achieved         |

### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The same items are visible to many players, provided they have the same role. In terms of item variety, this was not quite achieved - there are different item rarities and different items for each role, however there are only two items currently implemented, one for each role (Hunter and Hunted).&#x20;

This was primarily achieved in:

* [cycle-1-4.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-4.md "mention") (Implementation)
* [2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md "mention") (Rendering optimisations)

### Criterion 2

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

Picking up and dropping of items was implemented in [2.2.8-cycle-8-item-optimisation.md](../design-and-development/2.2.8-cycle-8-item-optimisation.md "mention"), and was judged to be intuitive and clear in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention")

### Criterion 3

This was not implemented due to time constraints and a significant underestimated of the scope I initially intended for my project.

### Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Hunter players can see each other on the map, and location updates will render for all hunters. This was implemented in [cycle-1-1.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-1.md "mention").

### Criterion 5

![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_create(iPhone 12 Pro).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_create(iPhone 12 Pro) (1) (1).png>)

Upon clicking on the ðŸŽ’ inventory button, players can see their items, and upon clicking on item, players can see their available actions. This was successfully implemented as demonstrated by the positive response in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention")

### Criterion 6

This was not implemented due to time constraints and a significant underestimated of the scope I initially intended for my project. This had a negative affect on the problem solving/critical thinking skills required for my game, as demonstrated in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention")

### Criterion 7

![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_(iPhone 12 Pro) (3).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_(iPhone 12 Pro) (4).png>)

When a Hunter is within range of a Hunted player, a large red Catch button will appear, with the targeted player listed underneath. Upon clicking Catch, the Hunted player is immediately disconnected and the Catch button would disappear from the screen. In this example, the game ends instead as all Hunted players have been caught.

This was completed in [2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md "mention") and was judged to be very usable and prominent, as concluded from [#criterion-11](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-11 "mention") in which all users agreed that the buttons in my game were clear and legible.

### Criterion 8

This was not implemented due to time constraints and a significant underestimated of the scope I initially intended for my project. Although I implemented several other items, there were none that could be "equipped" as such, and hence no UI for such a feature was created.

## User Interface

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                         | When was it achieved                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 9         | Alerts or item feedback (i.e. drones, public appeals), should be clear, large and easy to interpret | Achieved throughout (mainly Cycle 4, 5 and 7)  |
| 10        | Each item should have a clear accompanying description of what it does and it can be used           | Cycle 8 and 9                                  |
| 11        | All gameplay elements need to be legible and usable on a typical smartphone (iPhone 6)              | Achieved throughout (mainly Cycle 5)           |
| 12        | 2D satellite map view                                                                               | Cycle 3                                        |

### Criterion 9

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Alerts were used in a variety of Cycles, primarily in:

* [cycle-1-2.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-2.md "mention"): Alerts when users went out of bounds
* [cycle-1-3.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-3.md "mention"): Alerts when a player disconnected or reconnected.
* [2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md "mention"): Alerts when a player was caught and when the game is about to end.

In Usability Testing - [#criterion-9](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-9 "mention"), all respondents agreed that alerts were easy to read and understand.
