# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Mechanics

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                         | When was it achieved |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | The map contains a variety of items are visible to many players                                     | Cycle 6 & 7          |
| 2         | Players should be able to collect and drop items                                                    | Cycle 8              |
| 3         | Players should be able to merge items of the same level                                             | Not achieved         |
| 4         | Hunter players should be able to see each other on the map                                          | Cycle 3              |
| 5         | Players should be able to view and interact with their items                                        | Cycle 8 & 9          |
| 6         | Hunters should be able to complete mini-games or puzzles to reveal information about Hunted players | Not achieved         |
| 7         | Hunters should be able to capture Hunted players quickly and easily (when nearby)                   | Cycle 7              |
| 8         | There should be a clear way to see what items you have equipped, and to remove or change them       | Not achieved         |

### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The same items are visible to many players, provided they have the same role. In terms of item variety, this was not quite achieved - there are different item rarities and different items for each role, however there are only two items currently implemented, one for each role (Hunter and Hunted).&#x20;

This was primarily achieved in:

* [cycle-1-4.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-4.md "mention") (Implementation)
* [2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md "mention") (Rendering optimisations)

### Criterion 2

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)

Picking up and dropping of items was implemented in [2.2.8-cycle-8-item-optimisation.md](../design-and-development/2.2.8-cycle-8-item-optimisation.md "mention"), and was judged to be intuitive and clear in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention")

### Criterion 3

This was not implemented due to time constraints and a significant underestimated of the scope I initially intended for my project.

### Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Hunter players can see each other on the map, and location updates will render for all hunters. This was implemented in [cycle-1-1.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-1.md "mention").

### Criterion 5

![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_create(iPhone 12 Pro).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_create(iPhone 12 Pro) (1) (1).png>)

Upon clicking on the ðŸŽ’ inventory button, players can see their items, and upon clicking on item, players can see their available actions. This was successfully implemented as demonstrated by the positive response in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention")

### Criterion 6

This was not implemented due to time constraints and a significant underestimated of the scope I initially intended for my project. This had a negative affect on the problem solving/critical thinking skills required for my game, as demonstrated in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention")

### Criterion 7

![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_(iPhone 12 Pro) (3).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_(iPhone 12 Pro) (4).png>)

When a Hunter is within range of a Hunted player, a large red Catch button will appear, with the targeted player listed underneath. Upon clicking Catch, the Hunted player is immediately disconnected and the Catch button would disappear from the screen. In this example, the game ends instead as all Hunted players have been caught.

This was completed in [2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md "mention") and was judged to be very usable and prominent, as concluded from [#criterion-11](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-11 "mention") in which all users agreed that the buttons in my game were clear and legible.

### Criterion 8

This was not implemented due to time constraints and a significant underestimated of the scope I initially intended for my project. Although I implemented several other items, there were none that could be "equipped" as such, and hence no UI for such a feature was created.

## User Interface

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                         | When was it achieved                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 9         | Alerts or item feedback (i.e. drones, public appeals), should be clear, large and easy to interpret | Achieved throughout (mainly Cycle 4, 5 and 7)  |
| 10        | Each item should have a clear accompanying description of what it does and how it can be used       | Cycle 9                                        |
| 11        | All gameplay elements need to be legible and usable on a typical smartphone (iPhone 6)              | Achieved throughout (mainly Cycle 5)           |
| 12        | 2D satellite map view                                                                               | Cycle 3                                        |

### Criterion 9

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Alerts were used in a variety of Cycles to convey information in a clear yet unobtrusive way, primarily in:

* [cycle-1-2.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-2.md "mention"): Alerts when users went out of bounds
* [cycle-1-3.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-3.md "mention"): Alerts when a player disconnected or reconnected.
* [2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md "mention"): Alerts when a player was caught and when the game is about to end.

In Usability Testing - [#criterion-9](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-9 "mention"), all respondents agreed that alerts were easy to read and understand.

### Criterion 10

![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_(iPhone 12 Pro) (5) (1).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_(iPhone 12 Pro) (1).png>)

With the two items added in [2.2.9-cycle-9-gps-jammer-and-drone-search.md](../design-and-development/2.2.9-cycle-9-gps-jammer-and-drone-search.md "mention"), I made sure to write a short explanation of how they function. I think there's room for improvement here as some of the explanations may be unclear to someone who has never played the game. I might experiment with a separate, more detailed page which explains the purpose and functionality of each item in more depth in the future.

### Criterion 11

Throughout development I made sure to consider readability and clarity in my UI Mockups and when implementing a new feature I tried to ensure strong contrast ratios and font sizes with an absolute minimum of 16px. This criterion was assessed in Usability Testing - [#criterion-11](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-11 "mention"), and respondents unanimously agreed that my game fulfilled this criteria.

A large portion of ensuring a consistent and clear style was completed in [cycle-1-3.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-3.md "mention"), where I updated all the existing UI elements in my app to better match the styling determined in [1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md "mention").

### Criterion 12

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In [cycle-1-1.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-1.md "mention"), I decided to use `leaflet.js` as my map library and added Google Satellite View images, to ensure clear, up to date images. This approach also allowed me to exclude road and place names, adding a layer of problem solving to my game.

## Other

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                    | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 13        | There should be an easy way to define boundaries and playtime                  | Cycle 4              |
| 14        | Players should be able to create an account and join a game easily and quickly | Cycle 2              |

### Criterion 13

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The game time and area configuration screens were successfully implemented, however I feel there is still room for improvement. Several users told me that it was unclear that you had to draw a  game area, and how to start. Some users also found adding points and completing the polygon unintuitive. This is somewhat reflected in Usability Testing: [#criterion-13](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-13 "mention"), which received the worst overall feedback. In future development, I should probably add some clearer instructions to this screen.

The game time setting however, seemed clear to most users and is unlikely to require any modifications.

### Criterion 14

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was achieved in [2.2.2-cycle-2.md](../design-and-development/2.2.2-cycle-2.md "mention"), using Auth0 to provide the authentication logic, and easily allowing users to "Continue with Google". In many cases, this is only a two click process, and there is no need to set up an account. There is also the option to manually create an account if users so wish, to provide a variety of options to suit different people.

This will likely not require any modification and received favourable feedback in Usability Testing: [#criterion-14](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-14 "mention").

## Non-functional

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                | When was it achieved                 |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 15        | In-game actions, such as a player using, dropping or collecting an item should update immediately for all affected players | Cycle 8                              |
| 16        | Location updates must be smooth                                                                                            | Cycle 3 (partial)                    |
| 17        | The game must not crash                                                                                                    | Achieved throughout (mainly Cycle 5) |

### Criterion 15

{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jPOHC3hXSvu8Z1Zmkveb-NkuyWEFFhwD/view?usp=sharing" %}

As shown in the above video, item changes (dropping and picking up) on the map update almost immediately for both players. Admittedly, the server is running on the same computer so there is almost no networking delays, so more real-world testing is required to determine whether further development is required.

### Criterion 16

This was initially implemented in Cycle 3, using a CSS stylesheet. However, due to changes in how player location updates are rendered and updated on the map, the updates are no longer smooth. Due to its minimal effect on usability and gameplay, I did not prioritise fixing this, but in future development I would like to re-implement this "nice-to-have" feature.

### Criterion 17

Throughout [3.1-robustness.md](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md "mention"), my game did not crash in any major way and therefore, this Criterion was successfully met. I believe that this was due to code changes and standardisation made in [cycle-1-3.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-3.md "mention"), which allowed me to develop within a clear structure and ensured consistent type-safety.
