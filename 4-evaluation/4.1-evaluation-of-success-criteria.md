### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                         | When was it achieved |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | The map contains a variety of items are visible to many players                                     | Cycle 6 & 7          |
| 2         | Players should be able to collect and drop items                                                    | Cycle 8              |
| 3         | Players should be able to merge items of the same level                                             | Not achieved         |
| 4         | Hunter players should be able to see each other on the map                                          | Cycle 3              |
| 5         | Players should be able to view and interact with their items                                        | Cycle 8 & 9          |
| 6         | Hunters should be able to complete mini-games or puzzles to reveal information about Hunted players | Not achieved         |
| 7         | Hunters should be able to capture Hunted players quickly and easily (when nearby)                   | Cycle 7              |
| 8         | There should be a clear way to see what items you have equipped, and to remove or change them       | Not achieved         |

### Criterion 1

The same items are visible to many players, provided they have the same role. In terms of item variety, this was not quite achieved - there are different item rarities and different items for each role, however there are only two items currently implemented, one for each role (Hunter and Hunted).&#x20;

This was primarily achieved in:

* [cycle-1-4.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-4.md "mention") (Implementation)
* [2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md "mention") (Rendering optimisations)

### Criterion 2

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

Picking up and dropping of items was implemented in [2.2.8-cycle-8-item-optimisation.md](../design-and-development/2.2.8-cycle-8-item-optimisation.md "mention"), and was judged to be intuitive and clear in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention")

### Criterion 3

This was not implemented due to time constraints and a significant underestimated of the scope I initially intended for my project.

### Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Hunter players can see each other on the map, and location updates will render for all hunters. This was implemented in [cycle-1-1.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-1.md "mention").

### Criterion 5

![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_create(iPhone 12 Pro).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/localhost\_3000\_create(iPhone 12 Pro) (1) (1).png>)

Upon clicking on the ðŸŽ’ inventory button, players can see their items, and upon clicking on item, players can see their available actions. This was successfully implemented as demonstrated by the positive response in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention")

### Criterion 6

This was not implemented due to time constraints and a significant underestimated of the scope I initially intended for my project. This had a negative affect on the problem solving/critical thinking skills required for my game, as demonstrated in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention")

### Criterion 7
