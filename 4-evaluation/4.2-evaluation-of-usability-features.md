# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                    | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Physical movement in the real world was required to play the game                              | Success         |
| 2           | My game presented problems and items that requires users to problem solve and think critically | Partial Success |

### Feature 1

Instead of keyboard controls, my game used GPS co-ordinates, forcing people to go outside and physically walk around to collect items or catch players. Users judged my game to be highly successful at encouraging physical activity, and hence this will remain a core part of my game. In future, I'd like to add some fitness analytics so players can compete in other ways.

### Feature 2

My game currently includes two items and neither require solving of puzzles that were initially proposed in [#hacking-puzzles](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#hacking-puzzles "mention"), which was likely a large contributor to significant of "Neutral" responses to a question regarding this criteria in [#question-2](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-2 "mention"). Overall however, more than 50% of respondents agreed, and none said disagree when asked whether my game fulfilled this criteria. In future development, I want to add more items and puzzles to further improve my games effectiveness (especially to  [#older-gamers](../1-analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#older-gamers "mention"))

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                    | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Buttons that were easy to find                                 | Success      |
| 2           | An inventory that was quick to navigate and perform actions in | Success      |

### Feature 1

I ensured all buttons were large and either had text or a large icon to indicate their function. Creating UI Mockup before each cycle was very helpful in determining efficient button size and placement, and plan to continue with this strategy and my design style in future cycles.

### Feature 2

As discussed previously, button size and UI mockups were core parts of ensuring an efficient inventory system. All
