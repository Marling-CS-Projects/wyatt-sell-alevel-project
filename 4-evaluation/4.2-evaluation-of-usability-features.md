# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                                  | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Physical movement in the real world was required to play the game            | Success         |
| 2           | Problems and items that requires users to problem solve and think critically | Partial Success |

### Feature 1

Instead of keyboard controls, my game used GPS co-ordinates, forcing people to go outside and physically walk around to collect items or catch players. Users judged my game to be highly successful at encouraging physical activity, and hence this will remain a core part of my game. In future, I'd like to add some fitness analytics so players can compete in other ways.

### Feature 2

My game currently includes two items and neither require solving of puzzles that were initially proposed in [#hacking-puzzles](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#hacking-puzzles "mention"), which was likely a large contributor to significant of "Neutral" responses to a question regarding this criteria in [#question-2](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-2 "mention"). Overall however, more than 50% of respondents agreed, and none said disagree when asked whether my game fulfilled this criteria. In future development, I want to add more items and puzzles to further improve my games effectiveness (especially to  [#older-gamers](../1-analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#older-gamers "mention"))

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                    | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Buttons that were easy to find                                 | Success      |
| 2           | An inventory that was quick to navigate and perform actions in | Success      |
| 3           | Quick and simple controls for the map                          | Success      |

### Feature 1

I ensured all buttons were large and either had text or a large icon to indicate their function. Creating UI Mockup before each cycle was very helpful in determining efficient button size and placement, and plan to continue with this strategy and my design style in future cycles.

### Feature 2

As previously discussed, button size and UI mockups were core parts of ensuring an efficient inventory system. All respondents agreed it was efficient and allowed them to quickly perform their desired action, and hence, it will remain present in future development cycles.

### Feature 3

My map library has built-in support for gesture based navigation, making it ideal for smartphones, my target device. It uses identical controls to Google Maps, and therefore I feel that the zooming and panning gestures are suitably efficient and familiar. This was supported in my Usability Testing, although not as strongly as I would have liked - the testing was done on a computer, hence the gestures may have felt slightly less efficient.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                    | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Attractive design and graphics | Success      |
| 2           | Different items                | Fail         |

### Feature 1

I made sure to follow a predetermined design style that matched the "hacker" aesthetic I was attempting to emulate. This included sharp borders on buttons, strong contrast and a mono-spaced font. In future I'd like to ensure more consistency throughout the app with regard to buttons and colours, and add a dark mode for people that either:

* Want to play at night
* Prefer the appearance of a dark interface

### Feature 2

Although I failed to include a variety of items - only one for each player type, I implemented a system that allows for extendibility if I were to add items in future development. The reason for having a small amount of items is a result of an underestimation of the time various features would take me to implement. I certainly intend to add more items at a later stage as it will add a variety of new mechanics, boosting my game's engagement _and_ effectiveness - see above.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                                             | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game doesn't lag                                                    | Success      |
| 2           | The game doesn't crash                                                  | Success      |
| 3           | There are no significant glitches or bugs that make the game unplayable | Success      |

### Feature 1

When testing the game locally, with two clients, there was no lagging in terms of rendering or interacting with the game. I attribute some of this to my efforts in [2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-catching-players.md "mention"), where I focussed on improving the rendering performance of items in particular. As mentioned in [#criterion-15](4.1-evaluation-of-success-criteria.md#criterion-15 "mention"), the player location updates did not have smooth animations, but this doesn't constitute lagging.

Due to testing being conducted on a single device, it is difficult to ascertain whether my game would lag in the real world, and if it did, I would need to prioritise computation and rendering optimisations in future development.

### Feature 2

The game did not crash during my play testing, however there was an intermittent bug discovered in Usability Testing ([#question-9](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-9 "mention")) where the game crashed _after finishing_. As discussed earlier, the impact on usability is minimal, but it should be fixed in future development to ensure a more streamlined experience.

### Feature 3

There were no bugs that made the game "unplayable" - the only other issue discovered surrounded using two drone heat-maps at once: if a second drone was deployed while another was still active, its overlay would not be shown.

This does not significantly affect gameplay, however it may be frustrating some players, so I will endeavour to fix this in my future development efforts as part of my plan to improve item usage logic.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                      | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Clear descriptions of each item  | Success      |
| 2           | User-friendly alerts and buttons | Success      |
| 3           | A walkthrough or tutorial        | Fail         |
| 4           | Simple game creation             | Fail         |

### Feature 1

My game successfully implements descriptions that players agreed were easy to understand. As mentioned in [#criterion-10](4.1-evaluation-of-success-criteria.md#criterion-10 "mention"), these descriptions could still be improved and perhaps an extra page for each item could be added with images and diagrams explaining what each item does. This is fairly low priority, but would contribute to ensuring my game remains "easy to learn" as more items are added.

### Feature 2

Alerts and buttons were judged to be simple and easy to learn. The same button style will remain throughout, but I may add an accompanying icon to alerts to give more context - right now it's either  ❌ , ℹ️ or ✅, but these could be expanded upon depending the alerts content. As the alerts were unanimously judged to be clear, this will be very low priority.

### Feature 3

A walkthrough or tutorial was not implemented due to time constraints. I believe this will hugely improve my games "ease to learn", and would help first time players understand the game concept and how to actually play - it would also alleviate many of the confusions players mentioned in my survey and in person. I plan to implement this in the near future, as it improves a whole range of factors including making my game more engaging, popular and effective.

### Feature 4

As discussed in [#criterion-13](4.1-evaluation-of-success-criteria.md#criterion-13 "mention"), despite adding buttons in the game creation screen (specifically with regard to drawing the polygon) that I found intuitive, many users did not feel the same way. This could be alleviated by adding text on the page which explained how to create your game area, and would be part of the tutorial/walkthrough development effort discussed in [#feature-3-2](4.2-evaluation-of-usability-features.md#feature-3-2 "mention"). This is high priority as it makes it difficult for some players to _even begin playing my game._
